Convo	1	Casey	FloydLine	Casey	Um...excuse me...you're Mr.Coldwell right? I uh...wow oh my god I'm like actually a huge fan of yours.	CasFloR1L1Line	Floyd	"Ah, I see my reputation precedes me! It seems like SOME people at this table have some class."	CasFloR1L2Line	Casey	"Oh my god it is you! I was totally apart of one of your after school programs. I made little clay pots with animal faces on them and painted sometimes but...I mean you probably don't care about that but just...wow...everything you did for the community, all your work, it's so important. I can't believe I'm actually talking to you."	CasFloR1L3Line	Floyd	"This pleases me to no end. It is the youth like yourself that are the cornerstone of society, and art is our means of expression. Without art, without soul, what would we have left? Tell me, little artist, aside from the tiny clay pots, did you make anything else?"	CasFloR1L4Line	Casey	(clearly in awe) Wow. Stop this is so cool. Um...no not really? I really liked those tiny pots. I didn't really do anything with them but I had an army. A tiny pot army. Um..is...is it okay if I ask you questions? I just think you're the coolest. Sir. 	CasFloR1L5Line	Floyd	"Proceed, ask me what you may so that I may continue to help you, even in the afterlife."	CasFloR1L6Line	Casey	Thank you so much!! Okay so like..what do you think your greatest acheivement is? Or top 5 if that's too hard. 	CasFloR1L7Line	Floyd	"Oh that's easy. Establishing my Auction House represents everything that I've worked towards: the propogation of art and culture, and on a more personal level, a safe place for my family and myself."	CasFloR1L8Line	Casey	You're such an inspiration. This is so cool. I can't believe I get to be here with you. I guess dying wasn't so bad after all. Is that weird to say? That sounded better in my head. I'm not creepy I swear. 	CasFloR1L9Line	Floyd	"Stick with me, little sculptor, and I'll make sure that you see things in the afterlife that you only dreamed of."	CasFloR1L10Line	Casey	(tiny scream)	CasFloR1L11End						Convo	2	Casey	FloydLine	Casey 	"Mr. Coldwell, did you...enjoy your career? Yknow, when you were alive?"	CasFloR2L1Line	Floyd	"I not only enjoyed it, I THRIVED on it. As an artist, I was able to force my vision onto the canvas by sheer will. And as a CEO I could ensure that good art proliferated while criticisms from has-been artists were snuffed out."	CasFloR2L2Line	Casey 	"Oh...yeah that's...cool? I mean you must have met so many people, touched so many lives. You made people famous!"	CasFloR2L3Line	Floyd	"Yes, I was known to make a few artists, and I'll let you in on a little secret as well: I was known to break a few as well *chuckles* "	CasFloR2L4Line	Casey 	"Really? I mean...I'm sure you did it really nicely though, right? Like it was probably their dream to work with you...even if they weren't what you were looking for?"	CasFloR2L5Line	Floyd	"Little sculptor, let me teach you a lesson. When the untalented come your way, all you have to see is their lack of work and effort. I did these people a favor by telling them their art was worthless. I'm sure quite a few of them went on to luxiorious jobs flipping burgers, or salting french fries."	CasFloR2L6Line	Casey 	"(offput) Um...yeah? I guess? That seems kind of harsh...sir. Not that I would question your judgement or anything I just uh...I mean flipping burgers is a totally respectable thing to do too, right? (INNER TINA IS OFFENDED)"	CasFloR2L7Line	Floyd	Harsher would be allowing them to continue making art only to find that their lack of skill would lead them to misery and depravity. I showed them mercy.	CasFloR2L8Line	Casey 	"Wow that's uh...not what I expected? I don't think that's how it works. I mean I don't really know how it works but I feel like that's kind of mean? Just let people make their tiny pot armies, yknow? "	CasFloR2L9Line	Floyd	"It is unfortunate, little sculptor, that you died so young as to not know the harsh realities of life, but I assure you that had you lived longer would have seen that the strong prosper, and the weak exist at the whims of the strong."	CasFloR2L10Line	Casey 	"Dude...that's...that's messed up. I mean, no offense sir but...who hurt you?"	MissingLineEnd						Convo	3	Casey	FloydLine	Floyd	Casey...I sense that something I've said has upset you. Care to divulge?	CasFloR3L1Line	Casey	Um...I dunno. I guess I just thought you were really cool in life and now that I'm seeing you in person you're just..not as cool? 	CasFloR3L2Line	Floyd	Not...cool? There were memes made about me! I was rich! I had power! I was the standard by which COOL was judged.	CasFloR3L3Line	Casey	Yeah...I saw those memes. They weren't that great. They were mostly on reddit. 	CasFloR3L4Line	Floyd	(sotto) Mostly on Reddit. (Not sotto) I'll have you know that I don't CARE that you don't think I'm cool. What matter is COOL in the afterlife. Not that it means much coming from you.	CasFloR3L5Line	Casey	See? This is exactly what I'm talking about. I thought you were this cool genuinely nice philanthropic genius but honestly the more you talk the more I think you're just...kind of mean? And salty?	CasFloR3L6Line	Floyd	"I. AM. AN ARTIST. HOW DARE YOU SPEAK THAT WAY TO ME, INSOLENT BRAT. I've worked. I've put MY LIFE ON THE LINE. You know nothing of what I've seen or done. "	CasFloR3L7Line	Casey	Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.....are you okay?	CasFloR3L8Line	Floyd	"I AM DEAD. DO YOU THINK I'M OKAY. My family, my art, my legacy...what will become of it all without me there to control it."	CasFloR3L9Line	Casey	"Look, I'm sure your...legacy is fine without you. Honestly it's probably doing better..."	CasFloR3L10Line	Floyd	"You know nothing about what you speak, so I suggest you stay silent."	CasFloR3L11Line	Casey	Okeydokee artichokee.	CasFloR3L12End						Convo	4	Casey	FloydLine	Floyd	"I apologize for the way I've been acting. It's this PLACE. To be honest, I just want to get out of here already."	CasFloR4L1Line	Casey	"Hey, it's okay. It happens. I know all about neurotic outbursts, believe me. I totally get it. This place gives me the cuhhh-reeps."	CasFloR4L2Line	Floyd	"It's unfortunate you'll have to stay here longer. I'd say it gets better, but I'd be lying."	CasFloR4L3Line	Casey	"I mean...it's still anyone's game, right? I have just as muchofa chance of getting out of here as you do."	CasFloR4L4Line	Floyd	"Unfortunately no. I have no intention of allowing that to happen. I will not be spending one more day in this place. I'm leaving, and so help me, if you do ANYTHING to jeopardize that, I will find you, whereever you end up and I will find a way to make your afterlife an eternal well of misery. DO YOU HEAR ME!?"	CasFloR4L5Line	Casey	"I'm going to need you to take it down several notches. And you do know that threatening people who are already dead kind of loses its impact, right? I'm not scared of you, Mr. Coldwell. "	CasFloR4L6Line	Floyd	"That's an unfortunate miscalculation on your part, little sculptor. Power finds a way, from this life to the next, and I am not one who has been known to stop. Heed me. "	CasFloR4L7Line	Casey	"Okay first of all, the little sculptor thing is super creepy and I would really appreciate it if you stopped using it. Also, heed you? Do you hear yourself? Nobody talks like that."	CasFloR4L8Line	Floyd	"Oh does my word choice upset you? Perhaps you should have thought about that before you so brazenly antagonized me. But I AM capable of forgiveness, especially given the circumstances."	CasFloR4L9Line	Casey	"Yeah, I'm good, man. I don't really need your forgiveness. I mean if it makes you feel better, go ahead. But I'm fine. Also I didn't antagonize you I just...changed my opinion on you. "	CasFloR4L10Line	Floyd	"Fine then. Your apathy will make my conquest that much sweeter. Get ready, little sculptor."	CasFloR4L11Line	Casey	"Oh my god. Okay, little shit. You're on. "	CasFloR4L12End									Convo	1	Casey	NathanielLine	Nathaniel 	"Now, Casey, do not be afraid! Just because this is your first time and you are woefully inexpirienced does not mean you cannot prevail!"	CasNatR1L1Line	Casey 	Uh...thanks? I think?	CasNatR1L2Line	Nathaniel 	"You may not know how to play the game, and you may have gotten a lucky break, but those things are mere obstacles in your path to glory. We are all a forgiving bunch, after all. Do not be intimidated by our collective worldliness."	CasNatR1L3Line	Casey 	Uhhhhh....	CasNatR1L4Line	Nathaniel 	"I am sure the dealer will take good care of you! In all fairness, however, you should be prepared for defeat. It's only natural in gamesl ike this. Expirience gets a warrior further than mere luck alone. "	CasNatR1L5Line	Casey 	Are you trying to make me feel better?	CasNatR1L6Line	Nathaniel 	"Why yes! I believe it is my responsibility as eldest and longest standing member of this game that I give guidance to the younger, more impressionable members. "	CasNatR1L7Line	Casey 	Uh...not to be rude but...it's not? Really working?	CasNatR1L8Line	Nathaniel 	"Ah, what a shame. Perhaps I am losing my touch. Do not fret, I shall endeavor to improve this.

I have been thinking! You should be very proud that you made it to the next round! You are that much closer to victory!	CasNatR2L1Line	Casey 	Th-thanks...I uh--	CasNatR2L2Line	Nathaniel 	"While it is obviously pure luck that has gotten you this far, you should not discredit yourself. "	CasNatR2L3Line	Casey 	I...I wasn't. 	CasNatR2L4Line	Nathaniel 	Yes! Very good! Confidence in the face of total and complete proof that you are ill-equipped is the true mark of a warrior! 	CasNatR2L5Line	Casey 	Why do all of your compliments kind of sound like insults?	CasNatR2L6Line	Nathaniel 	Bah! Impossible! I would never insult someone so young and below my notice. It would be unworthy of me.	CasNatR2L7Line	Casey 	"See, you did it again, right there. And I'm obviously not below your notice because you keep talking to me..."	CasNatR2L8Line	Nathaniel 	"I...I seem to be upsetting you. I apologize, small one. I am not used to having someone of your intelligence and life expirience sitting at the same table as me. "	CasNatR2L9Line	Casey 	(deadpan) Oh my god. 	CasNatR2L10Line	Nathaniel 	"Do not fret, small one. It is very likely that this is your last round. And if by some miracle you manage to continue, you shall certainly meet your end there. You do not have to be afraid for much longer. "	CasNatR2L11Line	Casey 	(sotto) Why are you like this?

How is that you are so hostile, small one? I should think you would be happy getting this far. "	CasNatR3L3Line	Casey	Just because you've been here like six hundred years or something doesn't mean you have to be rude to newcomers. 	CasNatR3L4Line	Nathaniel	"Rude! Preposterous. I would never. And it has been four hundred and fifty years, thank you very much. "	CasNatR3L5Line	Casey	"Okay, well...I'm sorry. I'm bad at math. I uh... could you just stop giving me backhanded compliments and let me play in peace?"	CasNatR3L6Line	Nathaniel	"But half of the fun of playing a game is engaging in playful banter with your opponents, is it not? Perhaps children of this day and age do not have quite the developed sense of humor.  "	CasNatR3L7Line	Casey	My sense if humor is fine. I was on Tumblr. You don't even know what a meme is?	CasNatR3L8Line	Nathaniel	A meeeem? Sounds like a small animal. 	CasNatR3L9Line	Casey	"No, they're actually really funny um...they're kind of hard to explain. Its just stuff that people find funny, on the internet?"	CasNatR3L10Line	Nathaniel	Ah! The internet! I have heard of this! A vast network full of the depravity of mankind!	CasNatR3L11Line	Casey	"I mean sure, but there's also a lot of really good cat videos. "	CasNatR3L12Line	Nathaniel	"...Cat videos, you say? I used to have a sprightly feline friend. I named him Gilbert. He accompanied me to battle. "	CasNatR3L13Line	Casey	You had a cat in battle?	CasNatR3L14Line	Nathaniel	"Yes. A fearless sort, Gilbert was. "	CasNatR3L15Line	Casey	That's so cool! My cat would never have fought in battle. All she did was vomit. 	CasNatR3L16Line	Nathaniel	Ah. Charming.	CasNatR3L17Line	Casey	Yeah...	CasNatR3L18End						Convo	4	Casey	NathanielLine	Nathaniel	"Casey, I will freely admit that I did not think someone of your caliber deserved to be here. I have since changed my mind.

CasNatR4L4Line	Nathaniel	But you have proven yourself to be highly resourceful. A worthy opponent. I apologize for thinking less of you just because of your age and luck and lack of skill and---	CasNatR4L5Line	Casey	Thanks! Nathaniel! That's really nice of you. 	CasNatR4L6Line	Nathaniel	"I still do not aniticpate you winning this game, however. You have proven yourself to be remarkable but there is only so much luck one person can have. My skill shall undoubtedly prevail. "	CasNatR4L7Line	Casey	And good moment's gone. 	CasNatR4L8Line	Nathaniel	"Do not be discouraged, small one. Playing with me must have given you some bravery and life expirience. You may carry this interaction with you for as long as you remain in Purgatory. This is my gift to you."	CasNatR4L9Line	Casey	I...don't want it. 	CasNatR4L10Line	Nathaniel	"Nonsense! My skill and influence has undoubtedly shaped you into a better person. You should be grateful. Carry my memory with you into the rest of your years here, however long they may be. "	CasNatR4L11Line	Casey	You're the worst. 	CasNatR4L12Line	Nathaniel	How rude! Children these days have so little respect for their elders. 	CasNatR4L13Line	Casey	God you're worse than baby boomers.	CasNatR4L14Line	Nathaniel	Baby...baby boom-- that sounds highly inappropriate. Does a child of your age know what that entails? 	CasNatR4L15Line	Casey	This conversation is over.

You see, I was a knight of great honor and distinction! I started from very humble beginnings, mind you, but rose my way through the ranks by participating in glorious battles. The kinds of which you can not even imagine! Ah, how beautiful they were. "	FloNatR1L3Line	Floyd	"Glorious battles? Go on, I've been known to participate in some...feuds. Enlighten me of your prowess on the battlefield."	FloNatR1L4Line	Nathaniel	"Ah! But of course! Many enemies were felled by my greatsword. I took to the field by horse, feeling the thunderous beast pounding betwixt my thighs, the stench of blood in the air, a most beautiful perfume! In the name of country and king I fought valiantly to protect that which I loved. (getting choked up)"	FloNatR1L5Line	Floyd	It sounds like you had quite the relationship with this horse. Was it felled when you were? And tell me...how exactly DID that happen? A man such as yourself must not have gone down quietly into that dark night.	FloNatR1L6Line	Nathaniel	"Ah, a trusty steed follows his knight into death just as bravely as any of his men. A noble sir, that horse. I have never loved anything as I loved that horse in all the years since. But of course, it is natural one might be curious how I, such a skilled and competent warrior, was slain in battle! It is a sad tale. Are you truly interested in hearing such a thing? "	FloNatR1L7Line	Floyd	Yes and do tell me more about this horse and you.	FloNatR1L8Line	Nathaniel	"You are interested in Sedgewick? He was such a mighty beast. Coat as black as the night sky and soft as velvet. The day I was slain, he was cut from under me, and I went tumbling into the grass as the tendrils drank in his blood. "	FloNatR1L9Line	Floyd	"It is unfortunate to lose a good companion. I too lost my first love due to a foolish mistake, but I learned from that and got better. If only you and Sedgewick had had that oppurtunity. Very sad."	FloNatR1L10Line	Nathaniel	"So true, my friend, so very true. I am sorry to hear that you also suffered a deep loss in your heart. Perhaps it might one day be filled again. We can only hope."

FloNatR2L1Line	Floyd	"Well as it seems that we're all in the sharing mood why not. When I was a young lad, I lived with a terrible beast of a man who terrorized myself, my brother, and my sister. So I killed him. My GOD it feels good to say that out loud. Years of hiding my misdeeds have been tiresome to say the least."	MissingLineLine	Nathaniel	"I...Floyd, did you kill your own father?"	FloNatR2L3Line	Floyd	"Yes! Strangled him with my own two hands. It gave me years of tempestuous emotions to fuel my art. But really, he deserved it, much like the other people whose lives I've had to deal with."	MissingLineLine	Nathaniel	"How...how fascinating. I would not have thought you for a killer. But certainly, if the man was as cruel as you say, perhaps he deserved his untimely end by your hand. The only killing I ever did was in the name of battle but I suppose I can not consider myself above you in that sense. "	FloNatR2L5Line	Floyd	"Well, I wouldn't say a KILLER. Though I guess in an objective sense, I've had a certain capacity for cruelty. I remember the day an artist visited my exhibition and insulted my art. I had him beaten nearly to death. It was a great inspiration for my next work."	FloNatR2L6Line	Nathaniel	"My goodness...you, you had quite the thirst for violence, did you? I served with men like you. Knew them well in my childhood, as my days as a lowly theif, where a man would open your throat for you just for looking at you the wrong way. But you had to have love in your heart somewhere, did you not? You could not be cruel all the way down to your blood, could you?"	FloNatR2L7Line	Floyd	Oh a thief! Now this seems like a more interesting story than some paltry sense of love in my heart. How does a thief turn into a knight? Was it a horse? Did you find a nice horse to settle down with?	FloNatR2L8Line	Nathaniel	"Ah, well...it is not something I like to talk about. My past was very shameful. Very shameful indeed. The man I was then is long dead, I buried him in the ground beneath the gold plated armor of my boot! He will never rise again! NEVER!"	FloNatR2L9Line	Floyd	"The person inside us, who we all imagine dead, never is. They are always there, waiting for their moment to reappear. But hey now that's the fun of life isn't it?"

FloNatR2L11End						Convo	3	Floyd	NathanielLine	Floyd	"Nathaniel, just admit it, as a Knight you LOVED killing your enemy. It wasn't just the battle, or the idea, it was the ACT."	FloNatR3L1Line	Nathaniel	I-I- that's preposterous! How dare you make such an accusation! You are shaming all that I am as a knight! As a MAN!	FloNatR3L2Line	Floyd	"Now don't overreact, I'm merely pointing out that if you didn't like it, you wouldn't have done it. It's fine to have some demons, we all do. Some, perhaps yours, are more nefarious than others."	FloNatR3L3Line	nathaniel	"Perhaps mine!? You fool! You cannot hide your cruelty from me. You are a snake, lying in wait in tall green grasses! You are the blood of innocents! I see evil lurking behind thine eyes, do not try and pin your falsehoods on me! I am a man of honor! I fought to do away with my sins! They no longer blacken my soul!"	FloNatR3L4Line	Floyd	"Oh MY, temper temper. I think you have some potential, only those with the worst kind of demons would react as strongly as you at the mere SUGGESTION that they aren't are pure as they put on."	FloNatR3L5Line	nathaniel	"I...perhaps you have seen the truth of me, Floyd. A creature of such darkness as yourself could no doubt see its mirror image in my soul. But it is an old stain. Long forgotten. Still lingering, perhaps in my darkest hours, but I have done more work than you at scrubbing it clean. My darkness shames me. It clearly does not shame you.

FloNatR4L2Line	Nathaniel	"I...please do not call me that...I wanted to tell you that despite myself, I have grown to admire you. "	FloNatR4L3Line	Floyd	"Oh, and what did you in. My stunning good looks, my capacity for kindness?"	FloNatR4L4Line	Nathaniel	"Neither. Truly, it is your ability to be completely and utterly terrible. With no regard for how others see you, or for how the world sees you. You embrace your darkness in a way I have not yet seen before this day."	FloNatR4L5Line	Floyd	"Well that is certainly unexpected. For most people, my disregard for social mores is seen as a detterance and met with disdain."	FloNatR4L6Line	Nathaniel	"Well yes, I imagine that is most often the case. But, I have another confession. I did not grow to knighthood by my good deeds. I found a slain man and stole his armor, assumed his identity --I lived a lie, a glorious one, for my waking days. I have always found shame in that. Perhaps rightly so. But, seeing you give no...what is the term? Give no fuckings? About it all...well it has inspired me. "	FloNatR4L7Line	Floyd	"Nathaniel! I am impressed. Such a dark deed is one that I'm certain has plagued you to no end. That you would tell me, I am glad. "	FloNatR4L8Line	Nathaniel	"Yes, it has...troubled me deeply, even beyond death. But I feel lightened of it now. That it might instead give me strength, were I to embrace it. Open my arms to my own darkness. Wherever I may end up at the conclusion of this tournament, I will endeavor to make that a priority. "	FloNatR4L9Line	Floyd	"Perhaps then we shall make this a final battle worthy of us both. Let us both fight fiercly and without remorse or regret, as the warriors, and maybe monsters, that we are."	FloNatR4L10Line	Nathaniel	"I heartily accept this offer. You are a most worthy opponent, Floyd. It has been an honor. "	FloNatR4L11Line	Floyd	"As it has been for me as well, friend."	FloNatR4L12End						Convo	1	Floyd	ZombieLine	Floyd	"They call you Zombie, correct? How charming."	FloZomR1L1Line	Zombie	"That's right, pretty boy. I hear they call you Dickweed. "	FloZomR1L2Line	Floyd	"Ah, so you're as delightful as your namesake. What a startling revelation."	FloZomR1L3Line	Zombie	Why the fuck are you talking like that?	FloZomR1L4Line	Floyd	My apologies. I should have assumed someone like you would have a difficult time with vocabulary.	FloZomR1L5Line	Zombie	"My vocabulary is fine, fuckface. Just wondering why you're talking like a 16th century vampire."	FloZomR1L6Line	Floyd	You've just never been privvy to an ounce of sophistication in your entire life. 	FloZomR1L7Line	Zombie	"Oh, that's what you're calling it? Sophistication."	FloZomR1L8Line	Floyd	"Indeed. Sophistication, class, worldiness --I wouldn't imagine you'd understand. "	FloZomR1L9Line	Zombie	Holy shit do I really have to sit at a table with this asshole?	FloZomR1L10End						Convo	2	Floyd	ZombieLine	Zombie	I literally fucking hate you.	FloZomR2L1Line	Floyd	Me? I haven't said a thing. 	FloZomR2L2Line	Zombie	It's your whole fuckin' aura dude. I can just tell you're sitting here thinking you're better than everyone else.	FloZomR2L3Line	Floyd	"You would not be incorrect in that assumption. But I do not merely think I am, I know. "	FloZomR2L4Line	Zombie	"Seriously what the fuck is your malfunction?! We're all dead, asshole. We're all in the same fucking sinking ship. Get off your high horse."	FloZomR2L5Line	Floyd	"Death has not unmade me, Zombie. While I might not have retained my wealth, I have certainly retained my status here. I do not bend to the inane fears of those gathered in this place."	FloZomR2L6Line	Zombie	Oh? No? Then why are you playing? If you're not scared of this place why are you trying so hard to get out?	FloZomR2L7Line	Floyd	"Like any self-respecting person, I desire power. I feel a need to rise past my station. Purgatory limits me. I intend to see what lies beyond it. That is different than fear."	FloZomR2L8Line	Zombie	"What the fuck ever, man. That's a lot of fancy bullshit on top of the real issue here --is that you're trying to get out of here, just as much as any of us. So that makes us equals."	FloZomR2L9Line	Floyd	(laughing) Equals?! Equals. That's rich.	FloZomR2L10Line	Zombie	"Yuck it up, asswipe. You and I are more alike than you know. "	FloZomR2L11End						Convo	3	Floyd	ZombieLine	Floyd	"So...Janet, I've heard an interesting rumor about you on the lower levels. "	FloZomR3L1Line	Zombie	...What the fuck did you just call me?	FloZomR3L2Line	Floyd	"Janet. That's your name, isn't it? Your real name. It's rather delicate. I would never have thought."	FloZomR3L3Line	Zombie	Who the fuck told you? I'll kill them. Fuck you. Fuck this. You don't have the right to call me that. 	FloZomR3L4Line	Floyd	"Now, now. Let's not get upset. It's rather unbecoming of you to overreact. "	FloZomR3L5Line	Zombie	You're such a shit. You're exactly like those rich pigs I tried to take down when I...when...	FloZomR3L6Line	Floyd	"Oh, yes, your very heroic fireworks show that got you killed. Not much of a rebel if you died trying to prove a point, are you? No one will remember you, Janet. Is that what you fear?"	FloZomR3L7Line	Zombie	Shut. The fuck. Up. 	FloZomR3L8Line	Floyd	"I heard that you're waiting for someone here. Who is it, I wonder? A sibling? A friend? A lover?"	FloZomR3L9Line	Zombie	Stop talking. 	FloZomR3L10Line	Floyd	"How beautifully tragic. You are full of surprises, Janet."	FloZomR3L11End						Convo	4	Floyd	ZombieLine	Floyd	"Well, how approriate that it should be just the two of us at the end, dearest Janet."	FloZomR4L1Line	Zombie	"Floyd, I need you to shut the fuck up. "	FloZomR4L2Line	Floyd	"Shouldn't you just throw in the towel now? If the rumors I heard are correct, if you win this, you'll never be reunited with your beau in the languid halls of Purgatory. "	FloZomR4L3Line	Zombie	"Maybe not every rumor you've heard is true, dickweed. "	FloZomR4L4Line	Floyd	"Ah, but this one is, isn't it? Who are you waiting for, Janet?"	FloZomR4L5Line	Zombie	Stop calling me that.	FloZomR4L6Line	Floyd	"Would you like to let me win? I would be happy to take those chips from you. I am a benevolent man, after all."	FloZomR4L7Line	Zombie	"Benevolent my asshole. You're not even fucking human, dude. Stop trying to pry into my life and just play the goddamn game."	FloZomR4L8Line	Floyd	"Is banter not part of the game? Are you not enjoying our time together, Janet?"	FloZomR4L9Line	Zombie	I will literally rip your fucking teeth out if you keep calling me that. The name's Zombie. 	FloZomR4L10Line	Floyd	"So sensitive. That tough exterior of yours is all for show, just as the nickname is. You create a wall around yourself, hiding your true nature, your vulnerability. Why won't you let me in, Janet? "	FloZomR4L11Line	Zombie	Jesus fucking christ man. Stop trying to psychoanalyze me. You're not gonna like what you find.	FloZomR4L12Line	Floyd	Oh? On the contrary. I'm enjoying this very much.	FloZomR4L13Line	Zombie	Go fuck yourself. 	FloZomR4L14End						Convo	1	Nathaniel	ZombieLine	Zombie	"So...Nathaniel, what the fuck are you? "	NatZomR1L1Line	Nathaniel 	Excuse me?	NatZomR1L2Line	Zombie	Like...what's your deal?	NatZomR1L3Line	Nathaniel 	Ah! You'd like to hear the tales of my great heroism as a knight! 	NatZomR1L4Line	Zombie	Fuck that. Just wanna know how you died.	NatZomR1L5Line	Nathaniel 	"In glorious battle, of course! I lead a small complement of men on the field, swords blazing in the midday sun, blood raining like rubies! I still can feel where the tip of a spear opened my throat."	NatZomR1L6Line	Zombie	"Shit. That's fucking nuts, man. How fucking long have you been down here?!"	NatZomR1L7Line	Nathaniel 	"Four hundred and fifty years, give or take. It's difficult to keep track. "	NatZomR1L8Line	Zombie	(whistles) Hooooly shit. Damn I thought 20 years was bad. Aren't you supposed to become a dealer or something after losing for that long?	NatZomR1L9Line	Nathaniel 	"Ha! No offense to our dealer here, but I would prefer to meet my fate by the test of my mettle in battle! Perhaps if I had become a dealer, I would have met my fate sooner, but the thrill of the game is so much grander, don't you think? "	NatZomR1L10Line	Zombie	"Huh. Whatever you say, old man."	NatZomR1L11End						Convo	2	Nathaniel	ZombieLine	Zombie	Are you always this uptight? 	NatZomR2L1Line	Nathaniel	Are you always this rebellious and crass?	NatZomR2L2Line	Zombie	"Yeah, usually. Don't dodge the question, man. Don't you ever like let loose and let go of that knight in shining armor shit? "	NatZomR2L3Line	Nathaniel	"I am a man of honor! Chivarly never rests! You might do well to remember that, young lady."	NatZomR2L4Line	Zombie	Look I just want you to have some fun. You've been here for almost five hundred fucking years. It physically pains me to think you've been an uptight wad that entire time.	NatZomR2L5Line	Nathaniel	Uptight? Preposterous. I've never been accused of such a thing. 	NatZomR2L6Line	Zombie	"Nathaniel, the stick up your ass is so far up there that I can see it sticking out of your helmet."	NatZomR2L7Line	Nathaniel	"What would you have me do? Cuss and act as brashly as you? I have some decorum, thank you. "	NatZomR2L8Line	Zombie	"No, fuck no! Just be you, man. Let your hair down. Stop being so fuckin' nice to everyone all the time. "	NatZomR2L9Line	Nathaniel	Would you prefer I call you a...a disgusting lubberwort?!	NatZomR2L10Line	Zombie	"Oh yeah, a lubbertwort, keep it coming, talk dirty to me."	NatZomR2L11Line	Nathaniel	What?	NatZomR2L12Line	Zombie	What?	NatZomR2L13End						Convo	3	Nathaniel	ZombieLine	Nathaniel	"Ha! You know, Zombie, I actually rather enjoy being crass."	NatZomR3L1Line	Zombie	"See? I told ya, old man. You had it in you this whole time, you just never knew it."	NatZomR3L2Line	Nathaniel	Fuck! Shit! Arsehole! Dolt! Boil! Horse shit!	NatZomR3L3Line	Zombie	"Woahh, look out, we've got a badass over here. Careful, you're going to pull something. "	NatZomR3L4Line	Nathaniel	"(laughs like Santa probably) Oh, my dear Zombie. How I wish I had met you sooner. I've never had this much fun in Purgatory!"	NatZomR3L5Line	Zombie	"Stick around, grandpa. I'll show you the ropes. "	NatZomR3L6Line	Nathaniel	"Ah, but what if one of us is to win this encounter? If one of us were to leave, it would truly be a travesty. I must somehow return the favor. "	NatZomR3L7Line	Zombie	"Oh shit, no way, believe me, this has been great for me too. Consider us even. Just keep saying 'fuck'. "	NatZomR3L8Line	Nathaniel	Fuck! Fucking fuck fuckery! What fun!	NatZomR3L9Line	Zombie	They grow up so fast. Brings a tear to my eye. 	NatZomR3L10End						Convo	4	Nathaniel	ZombieLine	Zombie	"Well, Nate, it's been fun."	NatZomR4L1Line	Nathaniel	"It has been a fucking pleasure, Zombie. "	NatZomR4L2Line	Zombie	You ever gotten this close before? Made it to the final round? 	NatZomR4L3Line	Nathaniel	No! This is rather exhilirating! I feel my blood pumping through my veins once more. I feel alive! Virile! 	NatZomR4L4Line	Zombie	"Okay, stop. "	NatZomR4L5Line	Nathaniel	"(laughing) I apologize, I just haven't had this much fun since the battles of old! You remind me of my comrades, but tougher! Oh, the battles we could have fought, my friend."	NatZomR4L6Line	Zombie	"We could have rasied some hell, that's for sure. I could do some damage with a sword. "	NatZomR4L7Line	Nathaniel	"Oh ho, I believe it, my friend! If your blade was as sharp as your mouth, you could have cut down any enemy that stood in your path! Had I your gall, perhaps I might have lived long enough to see victory."	NatZomR4L8Line	Zombie	"Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. My gall didn't get me anywhere but this shithole. I actually probably could have used some self-restraint. "	NatZomR4L9Line	Nathaniel	Ha! You? Restrain yourself? 	NatZomR4L10Line	Zombie	"Yeah, right? I dunno, got any tips for me? If I end up gettin' out of here I'm gonna want to stay on Santa's nice list. "	NatZomR4L11Line	Nathaniel	Perhaps swear less? 	NatZomR4L12Line	Zombie	Fuck that.	NatZomR4L13Line	Nathaniel	"(chuckles) I happen to like you just the way you are, Zombie. I suggest wherever you end up, you continue being uniquely you. "	NatZomR4L14Line	Zombie	"Fuck off with that sappy shit, dick for brains. Just play the fucking game. "	NatZomR4L15Line	Nathaniel	"Ah yes! Let us continue the fuckery, you strumpet!"
