Convo	1	Casey	NathanielLine	Nathaniel 	"Now, Casey, do not be afraid! Just because this is your first time and you are woefully inexpirienced does not mean you cannot prevail!"	CasNatR1L1Line	Casey 	Uh...thanks? I think?	CasNatR1L2Line	Nathaniel 	"You may not know how to play the game, and you may have gotten a lucky break, but those things are mere obstacles in your path to glory. We are all a forgiving bunch, after all. Do not be intimidated by our collective worldliness."	CasNatR1L3Line	Casey 	Uhhhhh....	CasNatR1L4Line	Nathaniel 	"I am sure the dealer will take good care of you! In all fairness, however, you should be prepared for defeat. It's only natural in gamesl ike this. Expirience gets a warrior further than mere luck alone. "	CasNatR1L5Line	Casey 	Are you trying to make me feel better?	CasNatR1L6Line	Nathaniel 	"Why yes! I believe it is my responsibility as eldest and longest standing member of this game that I give guidance to the younger, more impressionable members. "	CasNatR1L7Line	Casey 	Uh...not to be rude but...it's not? Really working?	CasNatR1L8Line	Nathaniel 	"Ah, what a shame. Perhaps I am losing my touch. Do not fret, I shall endeavor to improve this. "	CasNatR1L9Line	Casey 	No really it's okay...if you could just...maybe not talk to me? At all? Ever again? 	CasNatR1L10End						Convo	2	Casey	NathanielLine	Nathaniel 	Casey! I have been thinking! You should be very proud that you made it to the next round! You are that much closer to victory!	CasNatR2L1Line	Casey 	Th-thanks...I uh--	CasNatR2L2Line	Nathaniel 	"While it is obviously pure luck that has gotten you this far, you should not discredit yourself. "	CasNatR2L3Line	Casey 	I...I wasn't. 	CasNatR2L4Line	Nathaniel 	Yes! Very good! Confidence in the face of total and complete proof that you are ill-equipped is the true mark of a warrior! 	CasNatR2L5Line	casey 	Why do all of your compliments kind of sound like insults?	CasNatR2L6Line	Nathaniel 	Bah! Impossible! I would never insult someone so young and below my notice. It would be unworthy of me.	CasNatR2L7Line	casey 	"See, you did it again, right there. And I'm obviously not below your notice because you keep talking to me..."	CasNatR2L8Line	nathaniel 	"I...I seem to be upsetting you. I apologize, small one. I am not used to having someone of your intelligence and life expirience sitting at the same table as me. "	CasNatR2L9Line	casey 	(deadpan) Oh my god. 	CasNatR2L10Line	nathaniel 	"Do not fret, small one. It is very likely that this is your last round. And if by some miracle you manage to continue, you shall certainly meet your end there. You do not have to be afraid for much longer. "	CasNatR2L11Line	casey 	(sotto) Why are you like this?	CasNatR2L12End						Convo 	3	Casey	NathanielLine	Nathaniel	"Casey...I have to admit, I am surprised you made it this far! It seems your blatant disregard for strategy and inept fumbling has worked in your favor! How delightful!"	CasNatR3L1Line	Casey	Please stop talking. 	CasNatR3L2Line	Nathaniel	"What? Why? How is that you are so hostile, small one? I should think you would be happy getting this far. "	CasNatR3L3Line	casey	Just because you've been here like six hundred years or something doesn't mean you have to be rude to newcomers. 	CasNatR3L4Line	Nathaniel	"Rude! Preposterous. I would never. And it has been four hundred and fifty years, thank you very much. "	CasNatR3L5Line	casey	"Okay, well...I'm sorry. I'm bad at math. I uh... could you just stop giving me backhanded compliments and let me play in peace?"	CasNatR3L6Line	Nathaniel	"But half of the fun of playing a game is engaging in playful banter with your opponents, is it not? Perhaps children of this day and age do not have quite the developed sense of humor.  "	CasNatR3L7Line	casey	My sense if humor is fine. I was on Tumblr. You don't even know what a meme is?	CasNatR3L8Line	Nathaniel	A meeeem? Sounds like a small animal. 	CasNatR3L9Line	casey	"No, they're actually really funny um...they're kind of hard to explain. Its just stuff that people find funny, on the internet?"	CasNatR3L10Line	Nathaniel	Ah! The internet! I have heard of this! A vast network full of the depravity of mankind!	CasNatR3L11Line	casey	"I mean sure, but there's also a lot of really good cat videos. "	CasNatR3L12Line	Nathaniel	"...Cat videos, you say? I used to have a sprightly feline friend. I named him Gilbert. He accompanied me to battle. "	CasNatR3L13Line	casey	You had a cat in battle?	CasNatR3L14Line	Nathaniel	"Yes. A fearless sort, Gilbert was. "	CasNatR3L15Line	casey	That's so cool! My cat would never have fought in battle. All she did was vomit. 	CasNatR3L16Line	nathaniel	Ah. Charming.	CasNatR3L17Line	casey	Yeah...	CasNatR3L18End						Convo	4	Casey	NathanielLine	Nathaniel	"Casey, I will freely admit that I did not think someone of your caliber deserved to be here. I have since changed my mind. "	CasNatR4L1Line	Casey	Is it because we're the only two people left?	CasNatR4L2Line	Nathaniel	Yes. 	CasNatR4L3Line	Casey	Okay cool. 	CasNatR4L4Line	Nathaniel	But you have proven yourself to be highly resourceful. A worthy opponent. I apologize for thinking less of you just because of your age and luck and lack of skill and---	CasNatR4L5Line	Casey	Thanks! Nathaniel! That's really nice of you. 	CasNatR4L6Line	Nathaniel	"I still do not aniticpate you winning this game, however. You have proven yourself to be remarkable but there is only so much luck one person can have. My skill shall undoubtedly prevail. "	CasNatR4L7Line	Casey	And good moment's gone. 	CasNatR4L8Line	Nathaniel	"Do not be discouraged, small one. Playing with me must have given you some bravery and life expirience. You may carry this interaction with you for as long as you remain in Purgatory. This is my gift to you."	CasNatR4L9Line	Casey	I...don't want it. 	CasNatR4L10Line	Nathaniel	"Nonsense! My skill and influence has undoubtedly shaped you into a better person. You should be grateful. Carry my memory with you into the rest of your years here, however long they may be. "	CasNatR4L11Line	Casey	You're the worst. 	CasNatR4L12Line	Nathaniel	How rude! Children these days have so little respect for their elders. 	CasNatR4L13Line	Casey	God you're worse than baby boomers.	CasNatR4L14Line	Nathaniel	Baby...baby boom-- that sounds highly inappropriate. Does a child of your age know what that entails? 	CasNatR4L15Line	Casey	This conversation is over. 	CasNatR4L16Line	Nathaniel	Hmph. I should hope so.	CasNatR4L17End						Convo	1	Casey	ZombieLine	Zombie	What are you looking at?	CasZomR1L1Line	Casey	"Oh! N-nothing! Nothing. Sorry. My eyes, they just, go, they are out of control my eyes are a mess I -"	CasZomR1L2Line	Zombie	"Shut up, I'm just fuckin' with you. Look where you want, small fry. "	CasZomR1L3Line	Casey	Wait do they have french fries down here? I would kill for some french fries. I know I just died like...yesterday but I'm already craving them. Is that weird?	CasZomR1L4Line	Zombie	"No french fries down here. Lots of booze. Wait, fuck, are you even old enough to drink?"	CasZomR1L5Line	Casey	Uh...does it matter? Do they enforce that stuff?	CasZomR1L6Line	Zombie	"No, but we don't get a lot of kids in Purgatory. "	CasZomR1L7Line	Casey	I'm not a kid! I'm eighteen!	CasZomR1L8Line	Zombie	"Oh, I'm sorry, you're right you're not a kid. You're a fucking infant. Hey dealer! Let's get the fetus a drink. "	CasZomR1L9Line	Casey	I...want to be mad but I feel like you're also being nice to me.	CasZomR1L10Line	Zombie	"You and I are gonna have fun! Stick with me, I'll show you the best of Purgatory, promise. "	CasZomR1L11End						Convo	2	Casey	ZombieLine	Casey 	Z-zombie?	CasZomR2L1Line	Zombie	(belches) What's up?	CasZomR2L2Line	Casey 	You died in the 80s?	CasZomR2L3Line	Zombie	Yuuuup.	CasZomR2L4Line	Casey 	Did uh...did you like the Sex Pistols?	CasZomR2L5Line	Zombie	Did I like the Sex Pistols?! Does a bear shit in the fucking woods?	CasZomR2L6Line	Casey 	(startled) Oh god...uh I...I assume...	CasZomR2L7Line	Zombie	Hell fucking yeah I liked the Sex Pistols! That was my first concert.  	CasZomR2L8Line	Casey 	"Wait what, really??"	CasZomR2L9Line	Zombie	"Yeah, ran away from home for a couple of days so I could go."	CasZomR2L10Line	Casey 	That's so cool. 	CasZomR2L11Line	Zombie	"Good times. First concert, first hangover, first time I stabbed a guy."	CasZomR2L12Line	Casey 	You...you stabbed a guy?	CasZomR2L13Line	Zombie	"Sure did. I mean, not fatally or anything. Just with a pocket knife. "	CasZomR2L14Line	Casey 	"Oh my god, why? "	CasZomR2L15Line	Zombie	Made fun of my Muppets shirt. 	CasZomR2L16Line	Casey 	(laughs uncomfortably)	CasZomR2L17End						Convo	3	Casey	ZombieLine	Zombie	"Casey, you ever stabbed anyone before?"	CasZomR3L1Line	Casey 	Not uh...not that I remember. 	CasZomR3L2Line	Zombie	"Oh, believe me. You'd remember. "	CasZomR3L3Line	Casey 	Then...no. Hard no.	CasZomR3L4Line	Zombie	Shame. It's pretty fucking wild. You're never the same after your first stabbing.	CasZomR3L5Line	Casey 	"Oh my god, how many people have you stabbed?!"	CasZomR3L6Line	Zombie	Apparently not enough to get me into Hell. But enough to know it's something everyone should do at least once in their lifetime. 	CasZomR3L7Line	Casey 	Is it weird that I'm simultaneously terrified and in awe of you? (Oh god please don't stab me.)	CasZomR3L8Line	Zombie	"Nah, I wouldn't stab you. You're my protege. I'm gonna make a mini Zombie out of you."	CasZomR3L9Line	Casey 	Please don't. 	CasZomR3L10End						Convo	4	Casey	ZombieLine	Casey 	I think there's been a mistake.	CasZomR4L1Line	Zombie	What do you mean?	CasZomR4L2Line	Casey 	"I mean...I don't think I was supposed to get to the end? I just got here. That Nathaniel guy has been playing for like 500 years and never got to the end. Why am I here? I did something wrong, right? They're going to come stab me."	CasZomR4L3Line	Zombie	"Calm the fuck down. You did everything right. They don't fuck around in here, no one messed up. Apparently you just got good cards and played them right. I mean, sure it's a goddamn miracle, but it's not a mistake. No offense. "	CasZomR4L4Line	Casey 	"Oh god, oh god I'm panicking. (Tina noise) I can't breathe. Is it possible to die in Purgatory? I think I'm dying. This is too much pressure. "	CasZomR4L5Line	Zombie	Fuck. No wonder you died young. Are you this anxious all the time?	CasZomR4L6Line	Casey 	(Tiny scream)	CasZomR4L7Line	Zombie	"Okay uh...well just think, if you lose, you're fine. If you win, you're fine. Everything is fucking fine. You either get out of here or you don't. And honestly if you don't, this shithole isn't all that bad. Free booze. People with shitty morals. It's like a party all the time. "	CasZomR4L8Line	Casey 	But everyone here is scary! 	CasZomR4L9Line	Zombie	"I'm the scariest motherfucker here, Casey. If you can handle me, you can handle everyone else. "	CasZomR4L10End						Convo	1	Nathaniel	ZombieLine	Zombie	"So...Nathaniel, what the fuck are you? "	NatZomR1L1Line	Nathaniel 	Excuse me?	NatZomR1L2Line	Zombie	Like...what's your deal?	NatZomR1L3Line	Nathaniel 	Ah! You'd like to hear the tales of my great heroism as a knight! 	NatZomR1L4Line	Zombie	Fuck that. Just wanna know how you died.	NatZomR1L5Line	Nathaniel 	"In glorious battle, of course! I lead a small complement of men on the field, swords blazing in the midday sun, blood raining like rubies! I still can feel where the tip of a spear opened my throat."	NatZomR1L6Line	Zombie	"Shit. That's fucking nuts, man. How fucking long have you been down here?!"	NatZomR1L7Line	Nathaniel 	"Four hundred and fifty years, give or take. It's difficult to keep track. "	NatZomR1L8Line	Zombie	(whistles) Hooooly shit. Damn I thought 20 years was bad. Aren't you supposed to become a dealer or something after losing for that long?	NatZomR1L9Line	Nathaniel 	"Ha! No offense to our dealer here, but I would prefer to meet my fate by the test of my mettle in battle! Perhaps if I had become a dealer, I would have met my fate sooner, but the thrill of the game is so much grander, don't you think? "	NatZomR1L10Line	Zombie	"Huh. Whatever you say, old man."	NatZomR1L11End						Convo	2	Nathaniel	ZombieLine	Zombie	Are you always this uptight? 	NatZomR2L1Line	Nathaniel	Are you always this rebellious and crass?	NatZomR2L2Line	Zombie	"Yeah, usually. Don't dodge the question, man. Don't you ever like let loose and let go of that knight in shining armor shit? "	NatZomR2L3Line	Nathaniel	"I am a man of honor! Chivarly never rests! You might do well to remember that, young lady."	NatZomR2L4Line	Zombie	Look I just want you to have some fun. You've been here for almost five hundred fucking years. It physically pains me to think you've been an uptight wad that entire time.	NatZomR2L5Line	Nathaniel	Uptight? Preposterous. I've never been accused of such a thing. 	NatZomR2L6Line	Zombie	"Nathaniel, the stick up your ass is so far up there that I can see it sticking out of your helmet."	NatZomR2L7Line	Nathaniel	"What would you have me do? Cuss and act as brashly as you? I have some decorum, thank you. "	NatZomR2L8Line	Zombie	"No, fuck no! Just be you, man. Let your hair down. Stop being so fuckin' nice to everyone all the time. "	NatZomR2L9Line	Nathaniel	Would you prefer I call you a...a disgusting lubberwort?!	NatZomR2L10Line	Zombie	"Oh yeah, a lubbertwort, keep it coming, talk dirty to me."	NatZomR2L11Line	Nathaniel	What?	NatZomR2L12Line	Zombie	What?	NatZomR2L13End						Convo	3	Nathaniel	ZombieLine	Nathaniel	"Ha! You know, Zombie, I actually rather enjoy being crass."	NatZomR3L1Line	Zombie	"See? I told ya, old man. You had it in you this whole time, you just never knew it."	NatZomR3L2Line	Nathaniel	Fuck! Shit! Arsehole! Dolt! Boil! Horse shit!	NatZomR3L3Line	Zombie	"Woahh, look out, we've got a badass over here. Careful, you're going to pull something. "	NatZomR3L4Line	Nathaniel	"(laughs like Santa probably) Oh, my dear Zombie. How I wish I had met you sooner. I've never had this much fun in Purgatory!"	NatZomR3L5Line	Zombie	"Stick around, grandpa. I'll show you the ropes. "	NatZomR3L6Line	Nathaniel	"Ah, but what if one of us is to win this encounter? If one of us were to leave, it would truly be a travesty. I must somehow return the favor. "	NatZomR3L7Line	Zombie	"Oh shit, no way, believe me, this has been great for me too. Consider us even. Just keep saying 'fuck'. "	NatZomR3L8Line	Nathaniel	Fuck! Fucking fuck fuckery! What fun!	NatZomR3L9Line	Zombie	They grow up so fast. Brings a tear to my eye. 	NatZomR3L10End						Convo	4	Nathaniel	ZombieLine	Zombie	"Well, Nate, it's been fun."	NatZomR4L1Line	Nathaniel	"It has been a fucking pleasure, Zombie. "	NatZomR4L2Line	Zombie	You ever gotten this close before? Made it to the final round? 	NatZomR4L3Line	Nathaniel	No! This is rather exhilirating! I feel my blood pumping through my veins once more. I feel alive! Virile! 	NatZomR4L4Line	Zombie	"Okay, stop. "	NatZomR4L5Line	Nathaniel	"(laughing) I apologize, I just haven't had this much fun since the battles of old! You remind me of my comrades, but tougher! Oh, the battles we could have fought, my friend."	NatZomR4L6Line	Zombie	"We could have rasied some hell, that's for sure. I could do some damage with a sword. "	NatZomR4L7Line	Nathaniel	"Oh ho, I believe it, my friend! If your blade was as sharp as your mouth, you could have cut down any enemy that stood in your path! Had I your gall, perhaps I might have lived long enough to see victory."	NatZomR4L8Line	Zombie	"Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. My gall didn't get me anywhere but this shithole. I actually probably could have used some self-restraint. "	NatZomR4L9Line	Nathaniel	Ha! You? Restrain yourself? 	NatZomR4L10Line	Zombie	"Yeah, right? I dunno, got any tips for me? If I end up gettin' out of here I'm gonna want to stay on Santa's nice list. "	NatZomR4L11Line	Nathaniel	Perhaps swear less? 	NatZomR4L12Line	Zombie	Fuck that.	NatZomR4L13Line	Nathaniel	"(chuckles) I happen to like you just the way you are, Zombie. I suggest wherever you end up, you continue being uniquely you. "	NatZomR4L14Line	Zombie	"Fuck off with that sappy shit, dick for brains. Just play the fucking game. "	NatZomR4L15Line	Nathaniel	"Ah yes! Let us continue the fuckery, you strumpet!"
