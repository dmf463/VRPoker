			Convo	1	Casey	FloydLine	Casey	Um...excuse me...you're Mr.Coldwell right? I uh...wow oh my god I'm like actually a huge fan of yours.	CasFloR1L1Line	Floyd	"Ah, I see my reputation precedes me! It seems like SOME people at this table have some class."	CasFloR1L2Line	Casey	"Oh my god it is you! I was totally apart of one of your after school programs. I made little clay pots with animal faces on them and painted sometimes but...I mean you probably don't care about that but just...wow...everything you did for the community, all your work, it's so important. I can't believe I'm actually talking to you."	CasFloR1L3Line	Floyd	"This pleases me to no end. It is the youth like yourself that are the cornerstone of society, and art is our means of expression. Without art, without soul, what would we have left? Tell me, little artist, aside from the tiny clay pots, did you make anything else?"	CasFloR1L4Line	Casey	(clearly in awe) Wow. Stop this is so cool. Um...no not really? I really liked those tiny pots. I didn't really do anything with them but I had an army. A tiny pot army. Um..is...is it okay if I ask you questions? I just think you're the coolest. Sir. 	CasFloR1L5Line	Floyd	"Proceed, ask me what you may so that I may continue to help you, even in the afterlife."	CasFloR1L6Line	Casey	Thank you so much!! Okay so like..what do you think your greatest acheivement is? Or top 5 if that's too hard. 	CasFloR1L7Line	Floyd	"Oh that's easy. Establishing my Auction House represents everything that I've worked towards: the propogation of art and culture, and on a more personal level, a safe place for my family and myself."	CasFloR1L8Line	Casey	You're such an inspiration. This is so cool. I can't believe I get to be here with you. I guess dying wasn't so bad after all. Is that weird to say? That sounded better in my head. I'm not creepy I swear. 	CasFloR1L9Line	Floyd	"Stick with me, little sculptor, and I'll make sure that you see things in the afterlife that you only dreamed of."	CasFloR1L10Line	Casey	(tiny scream)	CasFloR1L11End						Convo	2	Casey	FloydLine	Casey 	"Mr. Coldwell, did you...enjoy your career? Yknow, when you were alive?"	CasFloR2L1Line	Floyd	"I not only enjoyed it, I THRIVED on it. As an artist, I was able to force my vision onto the canvas by sheer will. And as a CEO I could ensure that good art proliferated while criticisms from has-been artists were snuffed out."	CasFloR2L2Line	Casey 	"Oh...yeah that's...cool? I mean you must have met so many people, touched so many lives. You made people famous!"	CasFloR2L3Line	Floyd	"Yes, I was known to make a few artists, and I'll let you in on a little secret as well: I was known to break a few as well *chuckles* "	CasFloR2L4Line	Casey 	"Really? I mean...I'm sure you did it really nicely though, right? Like it was probably their dream to work with you...even if they weren't what you were looking for?"	CasFloR2L5Line	Floyd	"Little sculptor, let me teach you a lesson. When the untalented come your way, all you have to see is their lack of work and effort. I did these people a favor by telling them their art was worthless. I'm sure quite a few of them went on to luxiorious jobs flipping burgers, or salting french fries."	CasFloR2L6Line	Casey 	"(offput) Um...yeah? I guess? That seems kind of harsh...sir. Not that I would question your judgement or anything I just uh...I mean flipping burgers is a totally respectable thing to do too, right? (INNER TINA IS OFFENDED)"	CasFloR2L7Line	Floyd	Harsher would be allowing them to continue making art only to find that their lack of skill would lead them to misery and depravity. I showed them mercy.	CasFloR2L8Line	Casey 	"Wow that's uh...not what I expected? I don't think that's how it works. I mean I don't really know how it works but I feel like that's kind of mean? Just let people make their tiny pot armies, yknow? "	CasFloR2L9Line	Floyd	"It is unfortunate, little sculptor, that you died so young as to not know the harsh realities of life, but I assure you that had you lived longer would have seen that the strong prosper, and the weak exist at the whims of the strong."	CasFloR2L10Line	Casey 	"Dude...that's...that's messed up. I mean, no offense sir but...who hurt you?"	CasFloR2L11End						Convo	3	Casey	FloydLine	Floyd	Casey...I sense that something I've said has upset you. Care to divulge?	CasFloR3L1Line	Casey	Um...I dunno. I guess I just thought you were really cool in life and now that I'm seeing you in person you're just..not as cool? 	CasFloR3L2Line	Floyd	Not...cool? There were memes made about me! I was rich! I had power! I was the standard by which COOL was judged.	CasFloR3L3Line	Casey	Yeah...I saw those memes. They weren't that great. They were mostly on reddit. 	CasFloR3L4Line	Floyd	(sotto) Mostly on Reddit. (Not sotto) I'll have you know that I don't CARE that you don't think I'm cool. What matter is COOL in the afterlife. Not that it means much coming from you.	CasFloR3L5Line	Casey	See? This is exactly what I'm talking about. I thought you were this cool genuinely nice philanthropic genius but honestly the more you talk the more I think you're just...kind of mean? And salty?	CasFloR3L6Line	Floyd	"I. AM. AN ARTIST. HOW DARE YOU SPEAK THAT WAY TO ME, INSOLENT BRAT. I've worked. I've put MY LIFE ON THE LINE. You know nothing of what I've seen or done. "	CasFloR3L7Line	Casey	Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.....are you okay?	CasFloR3L8Line	Floyd	"I AM DEAD. DO YOU THINK I'M OKAY. My family, my art, my legacy...what will become of it all without me there to control it."	CasFloR3L9Line	Casey	"Look, I'm sure your...legacy is fine without you. Honestly it's probably doing better..."	CasFloR3L10Line	Floyd	"You know nothing about what you speak, so I suggest you stay silent."	CasFloR3L11Line	Casey	Okeydokee artichokee.	CasFloR3L12End						Convo	4	Casey	FloydLine	Floyd	"I apologize for the way I've been acting. It's this PLACE. To be honest, I just want to get out of here already."	CasFloR4L1Line	Casey	"Hey, it's okay. It happens. I know all about neurotic outbursts, believe me. I totally get it. This place gives me the cuhhh-reeps."	CasFloR4L2Line	Floyd	"It's unfortunate you'll have to stay here longer. I'd say it gets better, but I'd be lying."	CasFloR4L3Line	Casey	"I mean...it's still anyone's game, right? I have just as muchofa chance of getting out of here as you do."	CasFloR4L4Line	Floyd	"Unfortunately no. I have no intention of allowing that to happen. I will not be spending one more day in this place. I'm leaving, and so help me, if you do ANYTHING to jeopardize that, I will find you, whereever you end up and I will find a way to make your afterlife an eternal well of misery. DO YOU HEAR ME!?"	CasFloR4L5Line	Casey	"I'm going to need you to take it down several notches. And you do know that threatening people who are already dead kind of loses its impact, right? I'm not scared of you, Mr. Coldwell. "	CasFloR4L6Line	Floyd	"That's an unfortunate miscalculation on your part, little sculptor. Power finds a way, from this life to the next, and I am not one who has been known to stop. Heed me. "	CasFloR4L7Line	Casey	"Okay first of all, the little sculptor thing is super creepy and I would really appreciate it if you stopped using it. Also, heed you? Do you hear yourself? Nobody talks like that."	CasFloR4L8Line	Floyd	"Oh does my word choice upset you? Perhaps you should have thought about that before you so brazenly antagonized me. But I AM capable of forgiveness, especially given the circumstances."	CasFloR4L9Line	Casey	"Yeah, I'm good, man. I don't really need your forgiveness. I mean if it makes you feel better, go ahead. But I'm fine. Also I didn't antagonize you I just...changed my opinion on you. "	CasFloR4L10Line	Floyd	"Fine then. Your apathy will make my conquest that much sweeter. Get ready, little sculptor."	CasFloR4L11Line	Casey	"Oh my god. Okay, little shit. You're on. "	CasFloR4L12End						Convo	1	Casey	MinnieLine	Casey	Wait... what's happening? Are you all real?	CasMinR1L1Line	Minnie	"You new here, kid?"	CasMinR1L2Line	Casey	I don't know? I think I died and then I was playing slots and then...oh god then I think I hit a jackpot and all this money came out and they told me I had to go play poker. Is that what this is?	CasMinR1L3Line	Minnie	"Oh, oh you're really new then. I've actually never seen someone get into the game this quick. I honestly didn't even know it could happen. "	CasMinR1L4Line	Casey	W-what? What do you mean you didn't think it could happen?! Am I not supposed to be here?	CasMinR1L5Line	Minnie	"Okay, just breathe. You're fine. Most people play for a bunch of years after they die to get here but you just happened to get lucky. There's nothing wrong with that. You just get your chance to get out of Purgatory quicker than most. "	CasMinR1L6Line	Casey	And I just have to...play poker?	CasMinR1L7Line	Minnie	That's it. 	CasMinR1L8Line	Casey	"Oh my god I don't know how to play poker! No one ever told me about this! They don't like teach you in school or anything and say like oh-- make sure you learn how to play poker before you die because you're going to have to play to decide whether you're going to heaven or eternal damnation! I mean I would have practiced or something oh god, oh god, oh god."	CasMinR1L9Line	Minnie	"Hey, hey, hey, relax. It's going to be okay! You'll get the hang of it. Just relax. "	CasMinR1L10Line	Casey	(wheezes)	CasMinR1L11End						Convo	2	Casey	MinnieLine	Casey 	"I just...can't believe I'm dead. I can't believe how I died. I tripped over nothing, literally nothing, and broke my neck. Who does that? Who?! God I hope someone is feeding my hamster. "	CasMinR2L1Line	Minnie	At least it was quick. You're luckier than a lot of other people here. 	CasMinR2L2Line	Casey 	"Uh...yeah, I guess I didn't think about it like that. Was having Scarlet Fever bad? Oh god, is that rude to ask? I'm so sorry I have no idea I have no social skills whatsoever I thought maybe I would magicially get them in death but apparently it doesn't work like that and I--  "	CasMinR2L3Line	Minnie	"Hey, relax. It's okay. Pretty standard fare around here. And yeah, it was pretty bad. Definitely not glamorous. "	CasMinR2L4Line	Casey 	"Oh man, I'm sorry. That sounds really scary. But you were a movie star before that right? That must have been so cool! I wonder if I've ever seen any movies you were in. I watched some silent films in my art class in eleventh grade but it was this weird guy with a creepy mustache. "	CasMinR2L5Line	Minnie	Charlie Chaplin. 	CasMinR2L6Line	Casey 	Yeah! That guy! 	CasMinR2L7Line	Minnie	I met him once. 	CasMinR2L8Line	Casey 	What?! No way! What was he like?	CasMinR2L9Line	Minnie	He always creeped me out. 	CasMinR2L10Line	Casey 	"Oh good, I thought I was the only one. "	CasMinR2L11End						Convo	3	Casey	MinnieLine	Minnie	"So Casey, what did you do while you were alive? "	CasMinR3L1Line	Casey	"Oh um...nothing cool. I uh, I had a big following on tumblr. I wrote a lot of fanfiction. "	CasMinR3L2Line	Minnie	I don't know what any of those words mean. 	CasMinR3L3Line	Casey	It's basically like writing stories but about pre-established worlds or franchises? I did a lot of Kim Possible fanficback in the day but recently I moved on to the Marvel universe. 	CasMinR3L4Line	Minnie	Umm...	CasMinR3L5Line	Casey	"I also had a lot of hermit crabs! Oh god, I miss them. There were two, Wanda and Pietro. I hope they're okay. And my hamster, Ham Solo. Jesus, what if Ham Solo ate them? Do hamsters eat crabs? I hope my mom is feeding them separately. "	CasMinR3L6Line	Minnie	I'm sure they're fine. 	CasMinR3L7Line	Casey	"I went to school too, but I wasn't very good at it. I had friends too! I mean...well, I had one friend. But that's okay because everyone in high school is dumb anyway. "	CasMinR3L8Line	Minnie	I didn't have that many friends either. 	CasMinR3L9Line	Casey	What? Really? You? 	CasMinR3L10Line	Minnie	"Yeah. It was too risky to trust anyone in my industry, and once I got out of the movie business my next job had even less savory people. Sometimes its better to be on your own. You know you can always count on yourself. "	CasMinR3L11Line	Casey	"Until you trip over your own feet and break your neck, I guess. (nervous laugh)"	CasMinR3L12Line	Minnie	"Yeah, but you're here now. Lucky or not, I'd say you're doing pretty good for yourself in the afterlife. "	CasMinR3L13Line	Casey	"Thanks, Minnie. "	CasMinR3L14End						Convo	4	Casey	MinnieLine	Casey 	How did this happen? How did this happen?	CasMinR4L1Line	Minnie	What's wrong?	CasMinR4L2Line	Casey 	There is absoutely no way I should be here right now. I like...barely know how to play poker! And now I'm almost at the end? What is going on?	CasMinR4L3Line	Minnie	"Sometimes, the cards just go your way. "	CasMinR4L4Line	Casey 	I don't deserve this! I got lucky on some crazy jackpot and now i'm here I only died yesterday I don't even know the rules of this place what makes me so special I literally tripped and broke my neck I...I--	CasMinR4L5Line	Minnie	"Casey! Breathe! Getting lucky doesn't mean you don't deserve this. You deserve to be here as much as anyone else. Actually, I'm pretty sure you deserve to be here more than most. You definitely deserve to be here more than Floyd did. "	CasMinR4L6Line	Casey 	You think so? Are you just saying that to be nice to me? I mean you are nice but are you just trying to make me feel better because I'm dead and worried about my hamster?	CasMinR4L7Line	Minnie	You got here on your own. No one told you what cards to play or what to do. Give yourself some credit. 	CasMinR4L8Line	Casey 	Why...why are you being so nice to me? Don't you want to win? You've been here since the thirties...I mean...I don't want to be rude but don't you want to get out of here? Shouldn't you be mean to me? Or threaten me or something? (small voice) Please don't...but I'm just saying. 	CasMinR4L9Line	Minnie	I dunno. I feel like you and I have something in common. 	CasMinR4L10Line	Casey 	"(seal noise) I'm sorry, what?! You and me? I'm like...the most awkward person ever. You're so cool. You're from the thirties! "	CasMinR4L11Line	Minnie	"First of all, the thirties weren't that great. I mean unless you were a rich white guy. Second, I'm actually not that cool. I just fake it. "	CasMinR4L12Line	Casey 	...Fake it? (sotto) I didn't know that was possible. 	CasMinR4L13Line	Minnie	"Yeah, well I've had a while to figure it out. Look, I've been here for a long time. If I win this game, great. If not, what's another fifty years? And I think someone like you deserves to get out of here. Better you than any of those other assholes."	CasMinR4L14Line	Casey 	You really think so?	CasMinR4L15Line	Minnie	"Yeah. You're a good kid, Casey. It's been fun playing with you. "	CasMinR4L16Line	Casey 	"Thanks, Mom. --- Oh god. I mean Minnie!

Just because this is your first time and you are woefully inexpirienced does not mean you cannot prevail!"	CasNatR1L1Line	Casey 	Uh...thanks? I think?	CasNatR1L2Line	Nathaniel 	"You may not know how to play the game, and you may have gotten a lucky break, but those things are mere obstacles in your path to glory. We are all a forgiving bunch, after all. Do not be intimidated by our collective worldliness."	CasNatR1L3Line	Casey 	Uhhhhh....	CasNatR1L4Line	Nathaniel 	"I am sure the dealer will take good care of you! In all fairness, however, you should be prepared for defeat. It's only natural in gamesl ike this. Expirience gets a warrior further than mere luck alone. "	CasNatR1L5Line	Casey 	Are you trying to make me feel better?	CasNatR1L6Line	Nathaniel 	"Why yes! I believe it is my responsibility as eldest and longest standing member of this game that I give guidance to the younger, more impressionable members. "	CasNatR1L7Line	Casey 	Uh...not to be rude but...it's not? Really working?	CasNatR1L8Line	Nathaniel 	"Ah, what a shame. Perhaps I am losing my touch. Do not fret, I shall endeavor to improve this. "	CasNatR1L9Line	Casey 	No really it's okay...if you could just...maybe not talk to me? At all? Ever again? 	CasNatR1L10End						Convo	2	Casey	NathanielLine	Nathaniel 	Casey! I have been thinking! You should be very proud that you made it to the next round! You are that much closer to victory!	CasNatR2L1Line	Casey 	Th-thanks...I uh--	CasNatR2L2Line	Nathaniel 	"While it is obviously pure luck that has gotten you this far, you should not discredit yourself. "	CasNatR2L3Line	Casey 	I...I wasn't. 	CasNatR2L4Line	Nathaniel 	Yes! Very good! Confidence in the face of total and complete proof that you are ill-equipped is the true mark of a warrior! 	CasNatR2L5Line	Casey 	Why do all of your compliments kind of sound like insults?	CasNatR2L6Line	Nathaniel 	Bah! Impossible! I would never insult someone so young and below my notice. It would be unworthy of me.	CasNatR2L7Line	Casey 	"See, you did it again, right there. And I'm obviously not below your notice because you keep talking to me..."	CasNatR2L8Line	Nathaniel 	"I...I seem to be upsetting you. I apologize, small one. I am not used to having someone of your intelligence and life expirience sitting at the same table as me. "	CasNatR2L9Line	Casey 	(deadpan) Oh my god. 	CasNatR2L10Line	Nathaniel 	"Do not fret, small one. It is very likely that this is your last round. And if by some miracle you manage to continue, you shall certainly meet your end there. You do not have to be afraid for much longer. "	CasNatR2L11Line	Casey 	(sotto) Why are you like this?	CasNatR2L12End						Convo	3	Casey	NathanielLine	Nathaniel	"Casey...I have to admit, I am surprised you made it this far! It seems your blatant disregard for strategy and inept fumbling has worked in your favor! How delightful!"	CasNatR3L1Line	Casey	Please stop talking. 	CasNatR3L2Line	Nathaniel	"What? Why? How is that you are so hostile, small one? I should think you would be happy getting this far. "	CasNatR3L3Line	Casey	Just because you've been here like six hundred years or something doesn't mean you have to be rude to newcomers. 	CasNatR3L4Line	Nathaniel	"Rude! Preposterous. I would never. And it has been four hundred and fifty years, thank you very much. "	CasNatR3L5Line	Casey	"Okay, well...I'm sorry. I'm bad at math. I uh... could you just stop giving me backhanded compliments and let me play in peace?"	CasNatR3L6Line	Nathaniel	"But half of the fun of playing a game is engaging in playful banter with your opponents, is it not? Perhaps children of this day and age do not have quite the developed sense of humor.  "	CasNatR3L7Line	Casey	My sense if humor is fine. I was on Tumblr. You don't even know what a meme is?	CasNatR3L8Line	Nathaniel	A meeeem? Sounds like a small animal. 	CasNatR3L9Line	Casey	"No, they're actually really funny um...they're kind of hard to explain. Its just stuff that people find funny, on the internet?"	CasNatR3L10Line	Nathaniel	Ah! The internet! I have heard of this! A vast network full of the depravity of mankind!	CasNatR3L11Line	Casey	"I mean sure, but there's also a lot of really good cat videos. "	CasNatR3L12Line	Nathaniel	"...Cat videos, you say? I used to have a sprightly feline friend. I named him Gilbert. He accompanied me to battle. "	CasNatR3L13Line	Casey	You had a cat in battle?	CasNatR3L14Line	Nathaniel	"Yes. A fearless sort, Gilbert was. "	CasNatR3L15Line	Casey	That's so cool! My cat would never have fought in battle. All she did was vomit. 	CasNatR3L16Line	Nathaniel	Ah. Charming.	CasNatR3L17Line	Casey	Yeah...	CasNatR3L18End						Convo	4	Casey	NathanielLine	Nathaniel	"Casey, I will freely admit that I did not think someone of your caliber deserved to be here. I have since changed my mind. "	CasNatR4L1Line	Casey	Is it because we're the only two people left?	CasNatR4L2Line	Nathaniel	Yes. 	CasNatR4L3Line	Casey	Okay cool. 	CasNatR4L4Line	Nathaniel	But you have proven yourself to be highly resourceful. A worthy opponent. I apologize for thinking less of you just because of your age and luck and lack of skill and---	CasNatR4L5Line	Casey	Thanks! Nathaniel! That's really nice of you. 	CasNatR4L6Line	Nathaniel	"I still do not aniticpate you winning this game, however. You have proven yourself to be remarkable but there is only so much luck one person can have. My skill shall undoubtedly prevail. "	CasNatR4L7Line	Casey	And good moment's gone. 	CasNatR4L8Line	Nathaniel	"Do not be discouraged, small one. Playing with me must have given you some bravery and life expirience. You may carry this interaction with you for as long as you remain in Purgatory. This is my gift to you."	CasNatR4L9Line	Casey	I...don't want it. 	CasNatR4L10Line	Nathaniel	"Nonsense! My skill and influence has undoubtedly shaped you into a better person. You should be grateful. Carry my memory with you into the rest of your years here, however long they may be. "	CasNatR4L11Line	Casey	You're the worst. 	CasNatR4L12Line	Nathaniel	How rude! Children these days have so little respect for their elders. 	CasNatR4L13Line	Casey	God you're worse than baby boomers.	CasNatR4L14Line	Nathaniel	Baby...baby boom-- that sounds highly inappropriate. Does a child of your age know what that entails? 	CasNatR4L15Line	Casey	This conversation is over.

CasZomR2L9Line	Zombie	"Yeah, ran away from home for a couple of days so I could go."	CasZomR2L10Line	Casey 	That's so cool. 	CasZomR2L11Line	Zombie	"Good times. First concert, first hangover, first time I stabbed a guy."	CasZomR2L12Line	Casey 	You...you stabbed a guy?	CasZomR2L13Line	Zombie	"Sure did. I mean, not fatally or anything. Just with a pocket knife. "	CasZomR2L14Line	Casey 	"Oh my god, why? "	CasZomR2L15Line	Zombie	Made fun of my Muppets shirt.

I did something wrong, right? They're going to come stab me."	CasZomR4L3Line	Zombie	"Calm the fuck down. You did everything right. They don't fuck around in here, no one messed up. Apparently you just got good cards and played them right. I mean, sure it's a goddamn miracle, but it's not a mistake. No offense. "	CasZomR4L4Line	Casey 	"Oh god, oh god I'm panicking. (Tina noise) I can't breathe. Is it possible to die in Purgatory? I think I'm dying. This is too much pressure. "	CasZomR4L5Line	Zombie	Fuck. No wonder you died young. Are you this anxious all the time?	CasZomR4L6Line	Casey 	(Tiny scream)	CasZomR4L7Line	Zombie	"Okay uh...well just think, if you lose, you're fine. If you win, you're fine. Everything is fucking fine. You either get out of here or you don't. And honestly if you don't, this shithole isn't all that bad. Free booze. People with shitty morals. It's like a party all the time. "	CasZomR4L8Line	Casey 	But everyone here is scary! 	CasZomR4L9Line	Zombie	"I'm the scariest motherfucker here, Casey.

I look forward to taking your money.	FloMinR1L1Line	Minnie	Ugh. Floyd. Should have known a snake like you would make his way up here in record time. How long have you been in Purgatory again? A year?	FloMinR1L2Line	Floyd	Three-hundred and sixty-four days tomorrow.	FloMinR1L3Line	Minnie	Congratulations.	FloMinR1L4Line	Floyd	"Come now, I thought you and I could be friends. Just because you've been through a bout of bad luck for the last century or so doesn't mean we have to be enemies. I've been known to help a friend in need."	FloMinR1L5Line	Minnie	That silver tongue isn't going to fool me. My career was full of men like you.	FloMinR1L6Line	Floyd	"Yes, the short-lived career as a film start you mean? (chuckles)"	FloMinR1L7End						Convo	2	Floyd	MinnieLine	Floyd	"That's a nice dress you have on, Minnie."	FloMinR2L1Line	Minnie	Thanks. I died in it. 	FloMinR2L2Line	Floyd	Mmm. Well it does wonders for your figure.	FloMinR2L3Line	Minnie	You gonna stare at my tits all night or are you going to play?	FloMinR2L4Line	Floyd	I'm sorry! My years as an artist gave me an appreciation for aesthetics! And didn't you die in the thirties? You're awfully crass for a wholesome Depression era woman.	FloMinR2L5Line	Minnie	"Yeah well, a few years in Purgatory will do that to a girl. I'm sure you fit right in, though. Misogynistic, chauvinistic, two-faced --this place was practically made for you. "	FloMinR2L6Line	Floyd	"Yes, I do seem to thrive in this environment.. But I'm eager to move on, as I'm sure you understand. "	FloMinR2L7Line	Minnie	"Yeah, we'll see about that."	FloMinR2L8Line	Floyd 	"Was that a challenge? You don't know who you're dealing with, little starlet."	FloMinR2L9End						Convo	3	Floyd	MinnieLine	Floyd	"Y'know, I've been thinking about something. "	FloMinR3L1Line	Minnie	Oh? and I'm sure you're going to tell us.	FloMinR3L2Line	Floyd	It's no secret that you were a failed actress in your living days. But I heard an interesting rumor about you moving onto darker dealing afterwards. That our ruined little starlet turned to bootlegging. 	FloMinR3L3Line	Minnie	"And? (Oh my, did history remember me that well?)"	FloMinR3L4Line	Floyd	"I just thought it was curious that you never mentioned this, yet you spend a grand time acting like you're somehow superior to everyone. "	FloMinR3L5Line	Minnie	I don't think I'm superior to everyone. Just to you. 	FloMinR3L6Line	Floyd	"Oh? Do enlighten me, Minnie dearest. We both seem to have operatd on the wrong side of the law in life, and yet here we both are: me after a year, you after, what 80 now?"	FloMinR3L7Line	Minnie	"But I never hurt people doing it. I care about people. That's why I'm better than you. I heard stories about you too, Floyd. The kind of shit you pulled in life was despicable."	FloMinR3L8Line	Floyd	"So talk has gone around, has it? I'm glad to know that my deeds are remembered. It would do well for you to remember them as well."

FloMinR4L1Line	Floyd 	"So concerned for me, are you darling? Upset you'll never see me again? Perhaps you've become fond of me."	FloMinR4L2Line	Minnie	Hardly. Just making conversation. 	FloMinR4L3Line	Floyd 	"Ah, well in that case. Truthfully I think Hell would suit me better, but I'm not picky. "	FloMinR4L4Line	Minnie	Want to know what I think?	FloMinR4L5Line	Floyd 	"Not in particular, but I get the feeling I'm about to find out."	FloMinR4L6Line	Minnie	"I think if you ever make it out of here, you're going to rot in Hell. It's not going to be the party you expect. It's going to be full of all the souls of the people you screwed over in life and they're going to torment you for the rest of eternity. It's the least you deserve."	FloMinR4L7Line	Floyd 	"So macabre. You certainly have a flair for the dramatics. I suppose we'll see, won't we?"	FloMinR4L8Line	Minnie	I suppose we will. 	FloMinR4L9Line	Floyd 	"Well, at any rate, it's been an honor to play with a woman of such beauty and skill. May the better, more wholesome person win. "	FloMinR4L10Line	Minnie	"Bite me, asshole. "	FloMinR4L11End						Convo	1	Floyd	NathanielLine	Nathaniel	"Floyd, my good man! You are a newcomer to Purgatory, are you not? I relish the idea of getting to know you! You obviously seem like a man of class and sophistication, such as I!"	FloNatR1L1Line	Floyd	"(Sarcastic) Oh please then, clearly a man with such a sense of worth should tell me about his life. "	FloNatR1L2Line	Nathaniel	"Why yes! I would be delighted! You see, I was a knight of great honor and distinction! I started from very humble beginnings, mind you, but rose my way through the ranks by participating in glorious battles. The kinds of which you can not even imagine! Ah, how beautiful they were. "	FloNatR1L3Line	Floyd	"Glorious battles? Go on, I've been known to participate in some...feuds. Enlighten me of your prowess on the battlefield."	FloNatR1L4Line	Nathaniel	"Ah! But of course! Many enemies were felled by my greatsword. I took to the field by horse, feeling the thunderous beast pounding betwixt my thighs, the stench of blood in the air, a most beautiful perfume! In the name of country and king I fought valiantly to protect that which I loved. (getting choked up)"	FloNatR1L5Line	Floyd	It sounds like you had quite the relationship with this horse. Was it felled when you were? And tell me...how exactly DID that happen? A man such as yourself must not have gone down quietly into that dark night.	FloNatR1L6Line	Nathaniel	"Ah, a trusty steed follows his knight into death just as bravely as any of his men. A noble sir, that horse. I have never loved anything as I loved that horse in all the years since. But of course, it is natural one might be curious how I, such a skilled and competent warrior, was slain in battle! It is a sad tale. Are you truly interested in hearing such a thing? "	FloNatR1L7Line	Floyd	Yes and do tell me more about this horse and you.	FloNatR1L8Line	Nathaniel	"You are interested in Sedgewick? He was such a mighty beast. Coat as black as the night sky and soft as velvet. The day I was slain, he was cut from under me, and I went tumbling into the grass as the tendrils drank in his blood. "	FloNatR1L9Line	Floyd	"It is unfortunate to lose a good companion. I too lost my first love due to a foolish mistake, but I learned from that and got better. If only you and Sedgewick had had that oppurtunity. Very sad."	FloNatR1L10Line	Nathaniel	"So true, my friend, so very true. I am sorry to hear that you also suffered a deep loss in your heart. Perhaps it might one day be filled again. We can only hope."	FloNatR1L11End						Convo	2	Floyd	NathanielLine	Nathaniel	Floyd! I admit I do not know much about you. Care to regale me with stories of your livelihood?	FloNatR2L1Line	Floyd	"Well as it seems that we're all in the sharing mood why not. When I was a young lad, I lived with a terrible beast of a man who terrorized myself, my brother, and my sister. So I killed him. My GOD it feels good to say that out loud. Years of hiding my misdeeds have been tiresome to say the least."	FloNatR2L2Line	Nathaniel	"I...Floyd, did you kill your own father?"	FloNatR2L3Line	Floyd	"Yes! Strangled him with my own two hands. It gave me years of tempestuous emotions to fuel my art. But really, he deserved it, much like the other people whose lives I've had to deal with."	FloNatR2L4Line	Nathaniel	"How...how fascinating. I would not have thought you for a killer. But certainly, if the man was as cruel as you say, perhaps he deserved his untimely end by your hand. The only killing I ever did was in the name of battle but I suppose I can not consider myself above you in that sense. "	FloNatR2L5Line	Floyd	"Well, I wouldn't say a KILLER. Though I guess in an objective sense, I've had a certain capacity for cruelty. I remember the day an artist visited my exhibition and insulted my art. I had him beaten nearly to death. It was a great inspiration for my next work."	FloNatR2L6Line	Nathaniel	"My goodness...you, you had quite the thirst for violence, did you? I served with men like you. Knew them well in my childhood, as my days as a lowly theif, where a man would open your throat for you just for looking at you the wrong way. But you had to have love in your heart somewhere, did you not? You could not be cruel all the way down to your blood, could you?"	FloNatR2L7Line	Floyd	Oh a thief! Now this seems like a more interesting story than some paltry sense of love in my heart. How does a thief turn into a knight? Was it a horse? Did you find a nice horse to settle down with?	FloNatR2L8Line	Nathaniel	"Ah, well...it is not something I like to talk about. My past was very shameful. Very shameful indeed. The man I was then is long dead, I buried him in the ground beneath the gold plated armor of my boot! He will never rise again! NEVER!"	FloNatR2L9Line	Floyd	"The person inside us, who we all imagine dead, never is. They are always there, waiting for their moment to reappear. But hey now that's the fun of life isn't it?"	FloNatR2L10Line	Nathaniel	"No...no I do not believe I can agree, my friend."	FloNatR2L11End						Convo	3	Floyd	NathanielLine	Floyd	"Nathaniel, just admit it, as a Knight you LOVED killing your enemy. It wasn't just the battle, or the idea, it was the ACT."	FloNatR3L1Line	Nathaniel	I-I- that's preposterous! How dare you make such an accusation! You are shaming all that I am as a knight! As a MAN!	FloNatR3L2Line	Floyd	"Now don't overreact, I'm merely pointing out that if you didn't like it, you wouldn't have done it. It's fine to have some demons, we all do. Some, perhaps yours, are more nefarious than others."	FloNatR3L3Line	Nathaniel	"Perhaps mine!? You fool! You cannot hide your cruelty from me. You are a snake, lying in wait in tall green grasses! You are the blood of innocents! I see evil lurking behind thine eyes, do not try and pin your falsehoods on me! I am a man of honor! I fought to do away with my sins! They no longer blacken my soul!"	FloNatR3L4Line	Floyd	"Oh MY, temper temper. I think you have some potential, only those with the worst kind of demons would react as strongly as you at the mere SUGGESTION that they aren't are pure as they put on."	FloNatR3L5Line	Nathaniel	"I...perhaps you have seen the truth of me, Floyd. A creature of such darkness as yourself could no doubt see its mirror image in my soul. But it is an old stain. Long forgotten. Still lingering, perhaps in my darkest hours, but I have done more work than you at scrubbing it clean. My darkness shames me. It clearly does not shame you. "	FloNatR3L6Line	Floyd	Clearly.	FloNatR3L7Line	Nathaniel	"You are insufferable. Conniving, insiduous, and too clever by a half. "	FloNatR3L8Line	Floyd	"Nathaniel, are you trying to sweet talk me? I'm flattered but I'm sorry, I must decline your advances."	FloNatR3L9Line	Nathaniel	"Blech! No, of course not, you heathen! (grumbles to self)"	FloNatR3L10End						Convo	4	Floyd	NathanielLine	Nathaniel	"Floyd, I must make a confession to you. "	FloNatR4L1Line	Floyd	"Tell me your sins, my child."	FloNatR4L2Line	Nathaniel	"I...please do not call me that...I wanted to tell you that despite myself, I have grown to admire you. "	FloNatR4L3Line	Floyd	"Oh, and what did you in. My stunning good looks, my capacity for kindness?"	FloNatR4L4Line	Nathaniel	"Neither. Truly, it is your ability to be completely and utterly terrible. With no regard for how others see you, or for how the world sees you. You embrace your darkness in a way I have not yet seen before this day."	FloNatR4L5Line	Floyd	"Well that is certainly unexpected. For most people, my disregard for social mores is seen as a detterance and met with disdain."	FloNatR4L6Line	Nathaniel	"Well yes, I imagine that is most often the case. But, I have another confession. I did not grow to knighthood by my good deeds. I found a slain man and stole his armor, assumed his identity --I lived a lie, a glorious one, for my waking days. I have always found shame in that. Perhaps rightly so. But, seeing you give no...what is the term? Give no fuckings? About it all...well it has inspired me. "	FloNatR4L7Line	Floyd	"Nathaniel! I am impressed. Such a dark deed is one that I'm certain has plagued you to no end. That you would tell me, I am glad. "	FloNatR4L8Line	Nathaniel	"Yes, it has...troubled me deeply, even beyond death. But I feel lightened of it now. That it might instead give me strength, were I to embrace it. Open my arms to my own darkness. Wherever I may end up at the conclusion of this tournament, I will endeavor to make that a priority. "	FloNatR4L9Line	Floyd	"Perhaps then we shall make this a final battle worthy of us both. Let us both fight fiercly and without remorse or regret, as the warriors, and maybe monsters, that we are."	FloNatR4L10Line	Nathaniel	"I heartily accept this offer. You are a most worthy opponent, Floyd. It has been an honor. "	FloNatR4L11Line	Floyd	"As it has been for me as well, friend."	FloNatR4L12End						Convo	1	Floyd	ZombieLine	Floyd	"They call you Zombie, correct? How charming."	FloZomR1L1Line	Zombie	"That's right, pretty boy. I hear they call you Dickweed. "	FloZomR1L2Line	Floyd	"Ah, so you're as delightful as your namesake. What a startling revelation."	FloZomR1L3Line	Zombie	Why the fuck are you talking like that?	FloZomR1L4Line	Floyd	My apologies. I should have assumed someone like you would have a difficult time with vocabulary.	FloZomR1L5Line	Zombie	"My vocabulary is fine, fuckface. Just wondering why you're talking like a 16th century vampire."	FloZomR1L6Line	Floyd	You've just never been privvy to an ounce of sophistication in your entire life. 	FloZomR1L7Line	Zombie	"Oh, that's what you're calling it? Sophistication."	FloZomR1L8Line	Floyd	"Indeed. Sophistication, class, worldiness --I wouldn't imagine you'd understand.

FloZomR2L1Line	Floyd	Me? I haven't said a thing. 	FloZomR2L2Line	Zombie	It's your whole fuckin' aura dude. I can just tell you're sitting here thinking you're better than everyone else.	FloZomR2L3Line	Floyd	"You would not be incorrect in that assumption. But I do not merely think I am, I know. "	FloZomR2L4Line	Zombie	"Seriously what the fuck is your malfunction?! We're all dead, asshole. We're all in the same fucking sinking ship. Get off your high horse."	FloZomR2L5Line	Floyd	"Death has not unmade me, Zombie. While I might not have retained my wealth, I have certainly retained my status here. I do not bend to the inane fears of those gathered in this place."	FloZomR2L6Line	Zombie	Oh? No? Then why are you playing? If you're not scared of this place why are you trying so hard to get out?	FloZomR2L7Line	Floyd	"Like any self-respecting person, I desire power. I feel a need to rise past my station. Purgatory limits me. I intend to see what lies beyond it. That is different than fear."	FloZomR2L8Line	Zombie	"What the fuck ever, man. That's a lot of fancy bullshit on top of the real issue here --is that you're trying to get out of here, just as much as any of us. So that makes us equals."	FloZomR2L9Line	Floyd	(laughing) Equals?! Equals. That's rich.	FloZomR2L10Line	Zombie	"Yuck it up, asswipe. You and I are more alike than you know. "	FloZomR2L11End						Convo	3	Floyd	ZombieLine	Floyd	"So...Janet, I've heard an interesting rumor about you on the lower levels. "	FloZomR3L1Line	Zombie	...What the fuck did you just call me?	FloZomR3L2Line	Floyd	"Janet. That's your name, isn't it? Your real name. It's rather delicate. I would never have thought."	FloZomR3L3Line	Zombie	Who the fuck told you? I'll kill them. Fuck you. Fuck this. You don't have the right to call me that. 	FloZomR3L4Line	Floyd	"Now, now. Let's not get upset. It's rather unbecoming of you to overreact. "	FloZomR3L5Line	Zombie	You're such a shit. You're exactly like those rich pigs I tried to take down when I...when...	FloZomR3L6Line	Floyd	"Oh, yes, your very heroic fireworks show that got you killed. Not much of a rebel if you died trying to prove a point, are you? No one will remember you, Janet. Is that what you fear?"	FloZomR3L7Line	Zombie	Shut. The fuck. Up. 	FloZomR3L8Line	Floyd	"I heard that you're waiting for someone here. Who is it, I wonder? A sibling? A friend? A lover?"	FloZomR3L9Line	Zombie	Stop talking. 	FloZomR3L10Line	Floyd	"How beautifully tragic. You are full of surprises, Janet."	FloZomR3L11End						Convo	4	Floyd	ZombieLine	Floyd	"Well, how approriate that it should be just the two of us at the end, dearest Janet."	FloZomR4L1Line	Zombie	"Floyd, I need you to shut the fuck up. "	FloZomR4L2Line	Floyd	"Shouldn't you just throw in the towel now? If the rumors I heard are correct, if you win this, you'll never be reunited with your beau in the languid halls of Purgatory. "	FloZomR4L3Line	Zombie	"Maybe not every rumor you've heard is true, dickweed. "	FloZomR4L4Line	Floyd	"Ah, but this one is, isn't it? Who are you waiting for, Janet?"	FloZomR4L5Line	Zombie	Stop calling me that.	FloZomR4L6Line	Floyd	"Would you like to let me win? I would be happy to take those chips from you. I am a benevolent man, after all."	FloZomR4L7Line	Zombie	"Benevolent my asshole. You're not even fucking human, dude. Stop trying to pry into my life and just play the goddamn game."	FloZomR4L8Line	Floyd	"Is banter not part of the game? Are you not enjoying our time together, Janet?"	FloZomR4L9Line	Zombie	I will literally rip your fucking teeth out if you keep calling me that. The name's Zombie. 	FloZomR4L10Line	Floyd	"So sensitive. That tough exterior of yours is all for show, just as the nickname is. You create a wall around yourself, hiding your true nature, your vulnerability. Why won't you let me in, Janet? "	FloZomR4L11Line	Zombie	Jesus fucking christ man. Stop trying to psychoanalyze me. You're not gonna like what you find.	FloZomR4L12Line	Floyd	Oh? On the contrary. I'm enjoying this very much.	FloZomR4L13Line	Zombie	Go fuck yourself.

MinNatR1L1Line	Minnie	Did you come up with that yourself?	MinNatR1L2Line	Nathaniel 	"Ha! I did indeed! I do not profess to be any glorious poet, of course. My passion was for the poetry of battle and the symphonies of steel against steel! But I shall admit that I have a certain flair for courting. "	MinNatR1L3Line	Minnie	Clearly. 	MinNatR1L4Line	Nathaniel 	You are a mysterious vixen indeed! I find your cold demeanor quite intoxicating. I am certain a hellfire smolders beneath that icy facade. Brave be the man that manages to crack it?	MinNatR1L5Line	Minnie	Does it have to be a man?	MinNatR1L6Line	Nathaniel 	"Oh! My apologies! How rude of me. I am no fair maiden, that is true. I did not realize you were...ah...of a certain disposition. "	MinNatR1L7Line	Minnie	Maybe you should check before you try out your lines on someone.	MinNatR1L8Line	Nathaniel 	"Ah, yes of course! I shall reflect upon this and try to better myself. Thank you, Minnie! I appreciate your candor. "	MinNatR1L9Line	Minnie	Nathaniel have you...have you ever talked to a woman before?	MinNatR1L10Line	Nathaniel 	Does this count?	MinNatR1L11End						Convo	2	Minnie	NathanielLine	Nathaniel	"Minnie, have you ever been in love?"	MinNatR2L1Line	Minnie	"Wow, you really don't hold back, do you?"	MinNatR2L2Line	Nathaniel	"I like to know the hearts of those I play with! It is important to understand ones soul to understand how they play. Plus, I am a romantic at heart. "	MinNatR2L3Line	Minnie	"Oh, are you? Have you ever been in love?"	MinNatR2L4Line	Nathaniel	"Mm. I once had a great love for my battle horse, Sedgewick. But the love of a woman was something I could never know in life. My heart was dedicated to battle. Though I often dreamed of a sweet maiden lying beside me, her softness, her scent, her breasts pressed up-"	MinNatR2L5Line	Minnie	Oh my god please stop.	MinNatR2L6Line	Nathaniel	"(clears throat) Ah yes, excuse me. I have a tendency to get a bit carried away. But to answer your question, I have never been in love, no. I was always too dedicated to my victories in battle. There was no room left in me for love."	MinNatR2L7Line	Minnie	Then you and I have at least one thing in common. 	MinNatR2L8Line	Nathaniel	Oh?	MinNatR2L9Line	Minnie	"I was too busy with work to bother trying to find someone to be with. I mean I slept with whoever I wanted to whenever I wanted to, but that's different. "	MinNatR2L10Line	Nathaniel	"A shame, then. I feel like we both have much love to give to the world. A terrible crime that we were never able to show it."	MinNatR2L11Line	Minnie	Eh. I don't regret missing out on it. 	MinNatR2L12End						Convo	3	Minnie	NathanielLine	Nathaniel	Minnie...would you...teach me how to court a woman?	MinNatR3L1Line	Minnie	Why are you assuming an I'm an expert?	MinNatR3L2Line	Nathaniel	"Oh..no, I did not mean to insinuiate anything. You are..just the only person I feel comfortable asking. "	MinNatR3L3Line	Minnie	I can't decide if that's sweet or sad. But sure what the hell. What do you want to know?	MinNatR3L4Line	Nathaniel	"Well...there is a certain fair maiden that I have seen around the lower levels that I have been trying to well up the courage to speak to, but thus far I have been far too cowardly."	MinNatR3L5Line	Minnie	"Okay well first, stop referring to her as a fair maiden. "	MinNatR3L6Line	Nathaniel	Noted.	MinNatR3L7Line	Minnie	What's she into? Do you know anything about her?	MinNatR3L8Line	Nathaniel	"Her hair is long an red as a sunset. Her eyes like jade fire, burning within the cavern of her beautifully shaped skull. Her hips are curved like the softest hills. "	MinNatR3L9Line	Minnie	....Do you know anything about her besides her apperance?	MinNatR3L10Line	Nathaniel	I...I do not.	MinNatR3L11Line	Minnie	Jesus Christ. 	MinNatR3L12Line	Nathaniel	"Are you saying I should attempt to see what she is interested in, and then engage in some kind of conversation surrounding that? Could I not just tell her about my battle prowess? "	MinNatR3L13Line	Minnie	"Yeah, how does that usually work out for you?"	MinNatR3L14Line	Nathaniel	Not...great.	MinNatR3L15Line	Minnie	Thought so.	MinNatR3L16End						Convo	4	Minnie	NathanielLine	Nathaniel	"Truthfully, I'm a bit disappointed I've made this far. To spend fifty years in life, and near five hundred in the afterlife, and to never know the taste of a loving woman."	MinNatR4L1Line	Minnie	A tragedy.	MinNatR4L2Line	Nathaniel	"But, I suppose there is still a chance I could lose. There is always the possibility of defeat. That is the true excitement of battle, after all. If I lose here today, I will make a promise to myself. I shall talk to that red headed woman by the slot machines. And if I win? Well..."	MinNatR4L3Line	Minnie	Maybe you'll get lucky and heaven will be full of hot women.	MinNatR4L4Line	Nathaniel	You truly think such a thing could be possible?!	MinNatR4L5Line	Minnie	"I mean, that's what I'm holding out for. Can't know for sure but that's what comforts me. "	MinNatR4L6Line	Nathaniel	What if the...hot...women... in heaven see me as every other woman has ever seen me?	MinNatR4L7Line	Minnie	As a tired old blowhard?	MinNatR4L8Line	Nathaniel	That was unnecessary. But...yes.	MinNatR4L9Line	Minnie	"Well, stop being a tired blowhard. You can't help being old at this point but if you find the right girl, she won't care about that. Stop telling war stories and listen to someone else for once. Most women just want one fucking day where they don't get talked over. "	MinNatR4L10Line	Nathaniel	I have...never considered that.	MinNatR4L11Line	Minnie	"Well it's a damn good thing it's you and me here at the end then, isn't it?"	MinNatR4L12Line	Nathaniel	"I suppose it is. I have enjoyed playing with you, Minnie."	MinNatR4L13Line	Minnie	"I mean, I want to say the feeling is mutual but it's not. "	MinNatR4L14Line	Nathaniel	Fair enough. 	MinNatR4L15Line	Minnie	But you've got potential. Don't count yourself out yet. 	MinNatR4L16End						Convo	1	Minnie	ZombieLine	Zombie	"Minnie, right?"	MinZomR1L1Line	Minnie	Mhmm. 	MinZomR1L2Line	Zombie	"And you were a movie star, right? Back in the twenties or something?"	MinZomR1L3Line	Minnie	Yup.	MinZomR1L4Line	Zombie	"Fuck. That's cool. You've got the face for it. Hell, you've got everything for it. "	MinZomR1L5Line	Minnie	Apparently didn't have the voice for it. Soon as sound came in they kicked me out.	MinZomR1L6Line	Zombie	Screw that! What the fuck that's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. Your voice is fuckin' heavenly. I want it to pin me against the wall and--	MinZomR1L7Line	Minnie	"Oh, wow. Okay. "	MinZomR1L8Line	Zombie	Just sayin. Those execs were batshit crazy to let something like you go. 	MinZomR1L9End						Convo	2	Minnie	ZombieLine	Zombie	"Say, if we both lose this thing maybe we could go back to Purgatory together. I could show you a good time. I know this bar on the fifth level that gets their liquor from demons or some shit. Least, that's what I heard. "	MinZomR2L1Line	Minnie	"A tempting offer, but I plan on winning this game."	MinZomR2L2Line	Zombie	"Sure, sure. Just, if the cards happen to go down the shitter, y'know who to call. I'd take you to all the best places. We could fuck on every blackjack table in this joint. "	MinZomR2L3Line	Minnie	(faintly amused) You make it sound so romantic. Were you a poet in life?	MinZomR2L4Line	Zombie	(snorts) Fuck no. 	MinZomR2L5Line	Minnie	What did you do?	MinZomR2L6Line	Zombie	"Got myself into trouble, usually. Listened to my music too loud. Tried to demolish the patriarchy. Blew up a building or two."	MinZomR2L7Line	Minnie	I'm sorry did you say blew up a building? 	MinZomR2L8Line	Zombie	"No, I said I blew up two buildings."	MinZomR2L9Line	Minnie	"Wow, you weren't kidding about showing a girl a good time. "	MinZomR2L10Line	Zombie	I never lie to people I wanna fuck. 	MinZomR2L11End						Convo	3	Minnie	ZombieLine	Minnie	"You don't really seem to care if you win or lose, Zombie. "	MinZomR3L1Line	Zombie	"Maybe I'm just tryin' keep me and you at the table, princess. "	MinZomR3L2Line	Minnie	You that sweet on me? 	MinZomR3L3Line	Zombie	I'd be all kinds of on ya if you gave me the chance. 	MinZomR3L4Line	Minnie	I'm serious. You play like you want to stay here or something.	MinZomR3L5Line	Zombie	Is the sense of mystery turning you on?	MinZomR3L6Line	Minnie	Maybe a little.	MinZomR3L7Line	Zombie	"Ha! I knew it! Man, if I'd met a woman like you while I was alive..."	MinZomR3L8Line	Minnie	Then what?	MinZomR3L9Line	Zombie	I...I dunno. Things would have been...different. 	MinZomR3L10End						Convo	4	Minnie	ZombieLine	Zombie 	Hey uh...Minnie?	MinZomR4L1Line	Minnie	Yes?	MinZomR4L2Line	Zombie 	Just wanted you to know that it's been really nice playin' with you. No matter what happens. A wild fuckin' ride I wouldn't wanna take with anyone else.	MinZomR4L3Line	Minnie	"That's sweet of you to say. I should thank you too, I've actually really enjoyed myself. "	MinZomR4L4Line	Zombie 	"Sucks that since we're both at the end there's no chance of us ending up in Purgatory together, huh? "	MinZomR4L5Line	Minnie	"It is kind of a shame. I was looking forward to getting to know you a little better, Zombie. "	MinZomR4L6Line	Zombie 	"Eh, if you win you'll probably find some sexy angel with big tits and forget all about little ol' me. "	MinZomR4L7Line	Minnie	"(laughs) Forget you? Not likely, darling. Besides, there's no saying you won't win this."	MinZomR4L8Line	Zombie 	"Yeah, I guess. Just a hunch. (pause) Y'know what, fuck it. Fuck it!"	MinZomR4L9Line	Minnie	What?	MinZomR4L10Line	Zombie 	My...real name is Janet. 	MinZomR4L11Line	Minnie	That's pretty. It suits you.	MinZomR4L12Line	Zombie 	I just...I just wanted you to know.	MinZomR4L13Line	Minnie	"It's been an honor playing with you, Janet. And who knows, maybe this isn't goodbye. Crazier things have happened."	MinZomR4L14Line	Zombie 	"Hah, shit I guess you're right. Okay then. Winner buys the first round. Deal?"	MinZomR4L15Line	Minnie	Deal. 	MinZomR4L16End						Convo	1	Nathaniel	ZombieLine	Zombie	"So...Nathaniel, what the fuck are you? "	NatZomR1L1Line	Nathaniel 	Excuse me?	NatZomR1L2Line	Zombie	Like...what's your deal?	NatZomR1L3Line	Nathaniel 	Ah! You'd like to hear the tales of my great heroism as a knight! 	NatZomR1L4Line	Zombie	Fuck that. Just wanna know how you died.	NatZomR1L5Line	Nathaniel 	"In glorious battle, of course! I lead a small complement of men on the field, swords blazing in the midday sun, blood raining like rubies! I still can feel where the tip of a spear opened my throat."	NatZomR1L6Line	Zombie	"Shit. That's fucking nuts, man. How fucking long have you been down here?!"	NatZomR1L7Line	Nathaniel 	"Four hundred and fifty years, give or take. It's difficult to keep track. "	NatZomR1L8Line	Zombie	(whistles) Hooooly shit. Damn I thought 20 years was bad. Aren't you supposed to become a dealer or something after losing for that long?	NatZomR1L9Line	Nathaniel 	"Ha! No offense to our dealer here, but I would prefer to meet my fate by the test of my mettle in battle! Perhaps if I had become a dealer, I would have met my fate sooner, but the thrill of the game is so much grander, don't you think? "	NatZomR1L10Line	Zombie	"Huh. Whatever you say, old man."	NatZomR1L11End						Convo	2	Nathaniel	ZombieLine	Zombie	Are you always this uptight? 	NatZomR2L1Line	Nathaniel	Are you always this rebellious and crass?	NatZomR2L2Line	Zombie	"Yeah, usually. Don't dodge the question, man. Don't you ever like let loose and let go of that knight in shining armor shit? "	NatZomR2L3Line	Nathaniel	"I am a man of honor! Chivarly never rests! You might do well to remember that, young lady."	NatZomR2L4Line	Zombie	Look I just want you to have some fun. You've been here for almost five hundred fucking years. It physically pains me to think you've been an uptight wad that entire time.	NatZomR2L5Line	Nathaniel	Uptight? Preposterous. I've never been accused of such a thing. 	NatZomR2L6Line	Zombie	"Nathaniel, the stick up your ass is so far up there that I can see it sticking out of your helmet."	NatZomR2L7Line	Nathaniel	"What would you have me do? Cuss and act as brashly as you? I have some decorum, thank you. "	NatZomR2L8Line	Zombie	"No, fuck no! Just be you, man. Let your hair down. Stop being so fuckin' nice to everyone all the time. "	NatZomR2L9Line	Nathaniel	Would you prefer I call you a...a disgusting lubberwort?!	NatZomR2L10Line	Zombie	"Oh yeah, a lubbertwort, keep it coming, talk dirty to me."	NatZomR2L11Line	Nathaniel	What?	NatZomR2L12Line	Zombie	What?	NatZomR2L13End						Convo	3	Nathaniel	ZombieLine	Nathaniel	"Ha! You know, Zombie, I actually rather enjoy being crass."	NatZomR3L1Line	Zombie	"See? I told ya, old man. You had it in you this whole time, you just never knew it."	NatZomR3L2Line	Nathaniel	Fuck! Shit! Arsehole! Dolt! Boil! Horse shit!	NatZomR3L3Line	Zombie	"Woahh, look out, we've got a badass over here. Careful, you're going to pull something. "	NatZomR3L4Line	Nathaniel	"(laughs like Santa probably) Oh, my dear Zombie. How I wish I had met you sooner. I've never had this much fun in Purgatory!"	NatZomR3L5Line	Zombie	"Stick around, grandpa. I'll show you the ropes. "	NatZomR3L6Line	Nathaniel	"Ah, but what if one of us is to win this encounter? If one of us were to leave, it would truly be a travesty. I must somehow return the favor. "	NatZomR3L7Line	Zombie	"Oh shit, no way, believe me, this has been great for me too. Consider us even. Just keep saying 'fuck'. "	NatZomR3L8Line	Nathaniel	Fuck! Fucking fuck fuckery! What fun!	NatZomR3L9Line	Zombie	They grow up so fast. Brings a tear to my eye. 	NatZomR3L10End						Convo	4	Nathaniel	ZombieLine	Zombie	"Well, Nate, it's been fun."	NatZomR4L1Line	Nathaniel	"It has been a fucking pleasure, Zombie. "	NatZomR4L2Line	Zombie	You ever gotten this close before? Made it to the final round? 	NatZomR4L3Line	Nathaniel	No! This is rather exhilirating! I feel my blood pumping through my veins once more. I feel alive! Virile! 	NatZomR4L4Line	Zombie	"Okay, stop. "	NatZomR4L5Line	Nathaniel	"(laughing) I apologize, I just haven't had this much fun since the battles of old! You remind me of my comrades, but tougher! Oh, the battles we could have fought, my friend."	NatZomR4L6Line	Zombie	"We could have rasied some hell, that's for sure. I could do some damage with a sword. "	NatZomR4L7Line	Nathaniel	"Oh ho, I believe it, my friend! If your blade was as sharp as your mouth, you could have cut down any enemy that stood in your path! Had I your gall, perhaps I might have lived long enough to see victory."	NatZomR4L8Line	Zombie	"Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. My gall didn't get me anywhere but this shithole. I actually probably could have used some self-restraint. "	NatZomR4L9Line	Nathaniel	Ha! You? Restrain yourself? 	NatZomR4L10Line	Zombie	"Yeah, right? I dunno, got any tips for me? If I end up gettin' out of here I'm gonna want to stay on Santa's nice list. "	NatZomR4L11Line	Nathaniel	Perhaps swear less? 	NatZomR4L12Line	Zombie	Fuck that.	NatZomR4L13Line	Nathaniel	"(chuckles) I happen to like you just the way you are, Zombie. I suggest wherever you end up, you continue being uniquely you. "	NatZomR4L14Line	Zombie	"Fuck off with that sappy shit, dick for brains. Just play the fucking game. "	NatZomR4L15Line	Nathaniel	"Ah yes! Let us continue the fuckery, you strumpet!"
