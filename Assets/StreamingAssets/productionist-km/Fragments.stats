	[[1bd4c39e-982f-4b14-ba02-80878ddb7fa3]] --> I don't think I can reasonably promise *actual* mermaids. We're not that sort of carnival.	None
	[[d7a1c325-2c6f-4370-a1e3-b620ce0cb89e]] --> Are you saying that your mermaids are fake? Are you promulgating falsified mermaids? Do the mermaids *know* they're fake?	None
	[[502f0ef6-c13d-4092-8bcf-b6a5f36e6594]] --> Calm down, sir, please. I am merely trying to explain the ways of carnival magic, so that you are not disappointed.	None
	[[d0c818f0-a4cd-4ff8-b457-6f3eaa4737fa]] --> I could not possibly manage to care less! Show me them!	None
	[[8fc7f11d-a2da-4429-868e-5c7b0faff047]] --> Your grammar is both deplorable and ambiguous, but please step this way.	None
	[[1b64bb61-264f-4823-bdbc-ca711bc9e284]] --> Oh, well, maybe I won't bother then. Maybe I just should head for the egress, as you types say.	None
	[[e4c6ee23-50d2-474a-b3b9-6318bac923a4]] --> We certainly do not. Please enjoy the remainder of your time here, brief though that may be.	None
	[[cb159411-d43b-4d3f-8e73-b967b1b28781]] --> I am exhausted, my friend. I have ridden six swirly rides and some sort of wheel with a steam whistle on it. I could not enter another tent if it had tea and biscuits.	None
	[[ff7a3b8b-44fc-4d8f-b3db-25eb4208e788]] --> I am delighted that our carnival has provided so many distracting entertainments. Shall I just fold you a balloon animal and send you on your way?	None
	[[4e293979-3248-443c-9aad-3561af5f8a1e]] --> Balloon animals? What kind of absurdity is that? Some kind of jellyfish?	None
	[[23975951-988f-412b-ab84-7389276be8b7]] --> Sir, you are about to witness the pinnacle of the circus arts. The very zenith! Watch as I extract this stretchy rubber widget from a concealed pocket...	None
	[[e718f265-aa6c-4b22-af22-aeeed1bf6b52]] --> Balloon animals? Is that all you have to offer?	None
	[[ad883517-c70e-4492-880c-b40100538217]] --> Not at all, sir, not at all. Allow me to display for you the arts of prestidigitation.	None
	[[0e8a00d7-9e2e-403f-91de-ba2a8d7278f1]] --> Balloons go pop! I couldn't bear it. No, I think that I'll go sit with the mermaids for a while.	None
	[[8b28bfff-bd4b-4972-9a99-1600682b91a6]] --> An excellent idea. They are most meditative. Please step inside.	None
	[[0e83bdcd-bb35-4dc5-9cc2-6aa25c9c1f04]] --> ...start of scene	None
	[[649f9058-11be-423c-b98f-1f49d98a2dc2]] --> How do you feel about Tarot cards?	None
	[[aefbcd8f-0607-42ea-a7df-66f26924041e]] --> I've never seen any. Do they have little pictures?	None
	[[518bcda4-98f7-4e7c-a3fe-d8071e838adf]] --> Let us say you are Cups, then.	None
	[[b128368d-b55c-4c99-917f-5a39f3dd713b]] --> I love Tarot cards! I look at the pictures for hours.	None
	[[8b7eba7b-0f77-418d-89f7-3caa9d0492fd]] --> Coins is your signifier, then.	None

	[[c048f5bc-4bca-4c3a-a362-f7d94e377c99]] --> Hm. How do you feel about the practice of divination?	None
	[[8eddf02c-b4e2-4953-a288-2418a658d673]] --> I could hardly trust a pile of cardboard bits to know me better than I know myself.	None
	[[833932c9-ec65-4c3e-a745-fd8e876271a4]] --> I would say you are a Swords, then.	None
	[[19c4c86a-82d7-43fb-8593-ea355216cfdd]] --> They're nothing but nonsense. No orthodox Astrosophist would touch them.	None
	[[babb7a3f-5c9e-4473-a1b9-1b5bb1ea7c49]] --> You're unquestionably a Wands sort.	None
	[[5c63ad1b-0d47-4e4a-84b8-9eac0f627f95]] --> I'm not at all sure I want to experiment.	None
	[[840ee353-d556-4ac8-827a-ae2598ee3a73]] --> I will retire the cards, then. You are, as they say, the executor of the will.	None
	[[86b8d7b8-0a18-4491-aac1-623b121874fc]] --> ...start of scene	None
	[[ec78a7ce-7be5-4b40-b7b2-0a186218733d]] --> Now we shall lay out the deck. [[drawcard]] Please shuffle your card back into the deck.	None

	[[c8f8a81a-c823-4d48-859d-385c12b1b3b6]] --> You have drawn the [[namecard]]! Delightful! But let us put the cards away; I'm sure I could never repeat that.	None
	[[4d25cd43-a4f1-45f5-8c53-eb35dd6cc536]] --> Will it be the same card?	None
	[[ff9737d2-11d5-4d00-8e9b-353cd5c2a02b]] --> Let us see! ...The [[randomcard]]. Apparently it will not be. I apologize.	None
	[[799b1b0d-6c64-4992-8229-8b2871ccfaaf]] --> Is this the same deck as before?	None
	[[7e83f7fa-8e70-4e15-9216-0b38807cf2b6]] --> The top card is... the [[randomcard]]. Oh dear. I am forced to admit that no, it is not. Let us dispose of the subject.	None
	[[69cc95d4-be05-4060-8501-ad2b19e6b160]] --> I'm never going to see that card again, am I?	None
	[[95fe2169-87c6-425c-b269-9c7e887a466a]] --> What fun would life be if the [[namecard]] never re-emerged? Here, draw a card.	None
	[[51c42826-33e4-45b1-9bf8-89777d83dd5f]] --> Does this card represent the future or the present?	None
	[[90d021e6-a10c-4143-b92d-e15765005a30]] --> Formally it represents the future of the past in which you originally drew it. Let us see, the [[namecard]]... [[prediction]] How disorienting. Let us have done with this.	None
	[[fc6bdddb-c774-40a8-9143-84128bd21a02]] --> I refuse to take part in this symbological travesty.	None
	[[825a30b4-282f-4ea7-86f9-f3824562a3bc]] --> As you wish. You are, as the idiom has it, the master of your fate and the captain of your soul. Let us never discuss what the [[namecard]] represents.	None

	[[7ac4f5c6-9164-4920-84f4-a022dac0828a]] --> That one is the [[randomcard]]. That's not right at all. Perhaps the [[randomcard]]? Or... no, this one is blank. This one is on fire. Perhaps we should desist.	None
	[[a02f48ae-c767-48da-98e5-8db4c5ddf3f8]] --> How does this trick work anyway?	None
	[[0bfa30dc-9a25-48dc-a77e-5b00525eca9d]] --> Oh, it's quite simple. You draw the [[namecard]]. Then I interpret: [[prediction]] Then a diffident and distrustful look passes over your face. Then I put the deck away.	None
	[[51234afc-aad8-4a92-9b62-0da2995c1207]] --> I can't wait!	None
	[[d5ba3eb8-1c33-4497-b2a0-03ac25a6bb48]] --> The [[randomcard]]? No, wait, the next card down is the [[namecard]]. That's a relief, isn't it? But enough prestidigitation for now.	None
